How JavaScript Works & Execution Context 
Core Concept
Everything in JavaScript happens inside an Execution Context â€” a container where the code runs.
Execution Context is like a big box with two main components:

Components of Execution Context
Memory Component (Variable Environment)
Stores variables and functions as key-value pairs.
Example: variable A = 10 stored with key "A" and value 10.
Also called the Variable Environment.

Code Component (Thread of Execution)
Executes JavaScript code one line at a time.
Also called the Thread of Execution.

JavaScript Execution Characteristics:-
JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language.
Single-threaded: Only one command runs at a time.
Synchronous: Commands run in order and the next line runs only after the current one finishes.

Important Notes
Despite Ajax (asynchronous calls) existence, core JavaScript execution is synchronous and single-threaded.
This core behavior means JavaScript cannot process multiple commands simultaneously in the main thread
