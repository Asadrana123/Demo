//A Promise is an object in JavaScript that represents the eventual
//completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

It can be in 3 states:

pending → not finished yet
fulfilled → success, has a value
rejected → failed, has an error


const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("done"), 1000);
});

p.then(value => console.log(value)); // after 1s → "done"
