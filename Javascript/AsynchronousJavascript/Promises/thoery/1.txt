Step 1 (mini) — What is a Promise?

A Promise is an object representing a value that will be available in the future (after async work).

It can be in 3 states:

pending → not finished yet

fulfilled → success, has a value

rejected → failed, has an error


const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("done"), 1000);
});

p.then(value => console.log(value)); // after 1s → "done"
