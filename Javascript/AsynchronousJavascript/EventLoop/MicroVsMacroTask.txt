Microtasks (higher priority â€“ run just after current JS execution, before macrotasks):
- Promise callbacks (.then, .catch, .finally)
- MutationObserver callbacks
- queueMicrotask()

Macrotasks (lower priority â€“ scheduled in task queue, run after microtasks are cleared):
- setTimeout
- setInterval
- setImmediate (Node.js only)
- requestAnimationFrame (browser only)
- I/O tasks (network events, DOM events, file system events)
- MessageChannel callbacks

ðŸ‘‰ Rule of thumb:
- Microtask = promises + microtask API (runs immediately after current execution).
- Macrotask = timers, events, rendering (runs in next event loop tick).
