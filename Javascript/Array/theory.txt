Array :- In JavaScript, arrays are sparse — meaning they can have “holes”
        (i.e., undefined elements in between).

sparse array :- A sparse array is an array where some indexes are missing — meaning there are holes 
between elements. These holes are not undefined values — they are truly missing entries in the array.

const arr = [1, 2, 3];

const arr = {
  0: 1,
  1: 2,
  2: 3,
  length: 3
};

if we do arr[5] then it will give us undefined

JavaScript Is Saying:
"I don’t care if you access an index I’ve never seen before. 
I’ll just give you undefined and move on."
