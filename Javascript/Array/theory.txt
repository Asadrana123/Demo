Array :- In JavaScript, arrays are sparse — meaning they can have “holes”
        (i.e., undefined elements in between).

sparse array :- A sparse array is an array where some indexes are missing — meaning there are holes 
between elements. These holes are not undefined values — they are truly missing entries in the array.

const arr = [1, 2, 3];

const arr = {
  0: 1,
  1: 2,
  2: 3,
  length: 3
};

if we do arr[5] then it will give us undefined

JavaScript Is Saying:
"I don’t care if you access an index I’ve never seen before. 
I’ll just give you undefined and move on."

:-[6] * 2 → "6" * 2 → 12
:-If [6] was [6, 7], it would become "6,7" * 2 → NaN.

Length of array:-The length of the array is determined by the highest index in the array, not the number 
of defined elements.
let arr = [];
arr[5] = 10;  // Setting an element at index 5
console.log(arr.length);  // Output: 6

for each:-.forEach() does not iterate over empty slots. It skips over them, 
unlike other methods such as map(), which leave an empty slot in the result.

:-Array indices must be non-negative integers (i.e., 0, 1, 2,...).

Negative Indices in slice() and splice()
slice(start, end):-
Negative values count from the end of the array.

Example:
If array = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
then:
slice(-4, -1) → start from 4th-last (which is 15) and go up to but not including the last one (which is 30), 
so result is:

sliced = [15, 20, 25]

spliced:-return the removed elements and make changes in origininal array 
syntax:-arr.splice(start,number of elements,...elements to add);

.every():-
The every() method is a built-in array method that checks whether all elements in an array pass the test
implemented by the provided function. It returns true if every element satisfies the condition, and false
if any element does not.
