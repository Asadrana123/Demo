In JavaScript, objects are collections of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings (or Symbols) 
and the values can be any type. They are used to store and organize data in a structured way.


A shallow copy duplicates only the top-level properties.
If there are nested objects, both the original and the copy still reference the same nested object.
A deep copy recursively copies all levels, so the copy is fully independent of the original.

The delete keyword is used to remove properties from objects. 
It returns true if the property is successfully deleted. However, 
it should not be used to remove elements from arrays,
 as it leaves holes â€” splice is better for that and nor it deletes variable value


JSON.stringify() is used to convert a JavaScript object or value into a JSON string.

JSON.parse() is used to convert a JSON string back into a JavaScript object.
