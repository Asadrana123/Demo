Every function in JavaScript (except arrow functions) automatically gets a prototype object when defined.
That prototype object by default has a constructor property that points back to the function itself.

JavaScript internally creates:
Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal
};


A constructor is a function that creates and initializes an object.
Every object (including functions) has a constructor property that points to the function 
that created it.
function Animal(name) {
    this.name = name;
}
Animal.prototype.sayHello = function () {
    console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
};
const dog = new Animal('Buddy');
console.log(dog.constructor === Animal);
