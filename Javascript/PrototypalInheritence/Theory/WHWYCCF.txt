Create a new empty object: JavaScript creates a new object, 
which will become the this context inside the constructor.

Set prototype: The new object's internal [[Prototype]] property is set 
to the constructor function's .prototype property.

Bind this: The constructor function is executed with this bound to the new object.

Initialize properties: Inside the constructor, properties are added or initialized on this.

Return the object: If the constructor does not explicitly return an object, 
JavaScript automatically returns the new object.
