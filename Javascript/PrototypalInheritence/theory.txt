console.log(function)	Shows the function code (source).
console.dir(function)	Shows the function as an object, including .prototype.

:-Object.create(Vehicle.prototype) and new Vehicle() are related but not exactly the same. 
They both create an object that inherits from Vehicle.prototype, but they do it in different ways:

Object.create(Vehicle.prototype):
This creates a new object and explicitly sets its prototype to Vehicle.prototype.
It does not invoke the Vehicle constructor, meaning the constructor's code 
(such as setting instance properties) 
won't be executed.

new Vehicle():
This creates a new object and sets its prototype to Vehicle.prototype,
just like Object.create(Vehicle.prototype).
However, new Vehicle() also calls the Vehicle constructor, 
which means any logic inside the constructor (such as initializing instance properties) is executed.
