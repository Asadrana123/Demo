A function that “remembers” the variables from the scope in which it was defined — 
even after that scope has finished executing.


Closures aren’t formed when you just write nested functions.
They're formed when you call the outer function, and  it defines the inner one — that’s
when the closure is “born” and locks onto the variables in that specific call.


difference between closure and scope:-

Scope: Controls access to a variable like decides which variable is accesible by which part of code.

Closure: Keeps track of variable even when the outer function is done with excuting
