Early-Stage Startup (1–50 employees)
Direct calls are common, and founders are heavily involved in hiring.

Best people to connect with:
Founder / Co-Founder (they often reply personally on LinkedIn)
Hiring Manager / Team Lead / Engineering Manager
Senior Engineer / Tech Lead (close to founder, strong say in hiring)
SDE (peer referral works, since teams are small)
HR / Recruiter (low priority; many startups don’t even have a dedicated HR)



Mid-Size Company (50–500 employees)

Startups become structured here: dedicated hiring managers and 
team leads drive hiring, but referrals still work well.

Best people to connect with:
Hiring Manager (Engineering Manager, Product Lead — strongest influence)
Senior Engineer / Tech Lead (likely to refer if they see your skills fit)
SDEs (still useful for referrals; mid-size firms reward referrals)
HR / Recruiter (secondary; they only screen after tech approves)
Founder (not as relevant; less involved at this size)



Large Company / Big Tech (500+ employees)

Hiring is highly structured and recruiters handle volume, but referrals 
from engineers carry huge weight.

Best people to connect with:
Hiring Manager (Director/Engineering Manager — strongest if reachable)
Senior Engineer / Staff Engineer / Tech Lead (their referrals are highly valued)
SDEs (good for referrals if senior isn’t reachable; best practical option)
HR / Recruiter (they’re the gatekeepers, only useful if you already applied)
Founder/CEO (irrelevant; no role in your application)
