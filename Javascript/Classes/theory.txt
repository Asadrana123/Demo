classes:- In JavaScript, classes are a way to create objects and handle object-oriented programming 
more cleanly and clearly.


What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
OOP is a programming style based on the concept of "objects".

These objects contain:

Properties (data) — like name, age

Methods (functions) — like greet(), login()

It helps you:

Organize code better 🔧

Reuse code more easily 🔁

Build scalable and maintainable applications 🏗️
