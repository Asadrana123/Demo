breakpoint:-A breakpoint is a spot in your code where you tell Chrome:
"Pause execution when you get here, and let me inspect what’s going on."

scope:-All the variables that are currently in scope — meaning:
✅ What the JavaScript engine can “see” at the paused point in execution.
What variables, functions, and values are available right now, at this exact line of code?”

Local:-Variables defined in the current function or block where the execution is currently paused.

Script:-The Script tab shows variables that are defined at the 
top level of the current script file, outside of any function.These variables are not added to the 
window object — they live in a different environment that DevTools calls Script.

Global:-The Global tab shows variables that are globally available — that is, properties of the 
global object (window in browsers).

why let and const not present in global tab:-When you declare something with **const** (or let) at the top level, it is not added to the global object 
— even though it's accessible globally within the module or script file.

Closure Tab:- This showsThe variables from outer lexical scopes that your function still has access 
to — even after those outer functions have finished execution.

:-It doesn’t display a “Closure” tab if the captured variables are from the global scope, 
because technically they're always accessible anyway.

:-Node.js wraps your code in a module, so top-level var is not added to the global object (global). 
wraps in a module means wraps code in a function 
example:-(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) Your code goes here )();

In JavaScript, only 7 values are falsy:
