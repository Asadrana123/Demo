//The real power of DOM manipulation comes when your page can respond to user actions â€” clicks, typing, 
//hovering, etc. These are called events.
// click	When an element is clicked
// mouseover	When mouse hovers over element
// keydown	When a key is pressed
// submit	When a form is submitted
// input	When typing into an input box
