//The DOM is an object-based representation of the web page that allows JavaScript to interact 
//with and manipulate the content and structure dynamically.
//Think of the DOM as a map of your webpage.

//When your HTML page loads, the browser builds a tree of elements. 
// This tree is what JavaScript uses to read or change things on your page (like text, color, etc.).
