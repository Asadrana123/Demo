function:- A function in JavaScript is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. 
It allows us to write a piece of logic once and reuse it multiple times.


IIFE:-An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a function that is defined and 
invoked immediately. It's often used to create a new scope and
avoid polluting the global namespace.

Arguments:-arguments is a built-in object available inside every regular function (but not in arrow functions).
It behaves like an array (but isn't a real array) and contains all the arguments passed to the function

Rest Operator:- Collects values into an array or object (used in function parameters,
array/object destructuring).

Spread Operator:- Spreads elements from an array or object into a new array or object 
(used for copying or merging).

*call,bind and apply not work for arrow function it always takes value of this keyword from outer scope

difference between arrow and regular function:-
1.Hoisting
2.this binding
3.constructor functions
4.arrow function do not have arguments object 

:-Arrow functions should be avoided as object methods if you need to access the objectâ€™s properties using this. 
Instead, use regular functions, which correctly bind this to the object that calls the method.
