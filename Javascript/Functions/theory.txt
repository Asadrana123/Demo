function:- A function in JavaScript is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. 
It allows us to write a piece of logic once and reuse it multiple times.


IIFE:-An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a function that is defined and 
invoked immediately. It's often used to create a new scope and
avoid polluting the global namespace.
