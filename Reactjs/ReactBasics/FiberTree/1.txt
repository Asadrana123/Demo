ðŸ”¥ What is the Fiber Tree?
The Fiber Tree is a linked tree of Fiber Nodes â€” each representing a 
React element (component or DOM node). It is Reactâ€™s internal data structure that tracks 
the current UI and work-in-progress updates.

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <Main />
    </div>
  );
}

function Header() {
  return <h1>Hello!</h1>;
}

function Main() {
  return <p>Welcome!</p>;
}


FiberNode: App (type: FunctionComponent)
 â””â”€ FiberNode: div (type: HostComponent)
      â”œâ”€ FiberNode: Header (type: FunctionComponent)
      â”‚    â””â”€ FiberNode: h1 (type: HostComponent)
      â””â”€ FiberNode: Main (type: FunctionComponent)
           â””â”€ FiberNode: p (type: HostComponent)
