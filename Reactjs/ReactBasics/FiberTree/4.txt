2️⃣ Double Buffering — current & workInProgress Fibers
React uses a double buffering approach:

Current Fiber Tree: Represents what’s currently rendered and committed on the screen.
Work-In-Progress (WIP) Fiber Tree: The new tree React is building during the render phase.
Every Fiber Node has an alternate pointer linking it to its counterpart in the other tree.

During render, React traverses and mutates the WIP tree without touching the current tree.
Once done, React swaps the trees.
