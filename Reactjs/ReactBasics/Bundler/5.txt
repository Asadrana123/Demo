âœ… What is a Plugin (General Definition)
A plugin is a tool or piece of software that adds extra features or functionality to an existing program, 
without changing its core code.

ðŸ§  Example: Like a Chrome extension â€” adds power without touching the browser itself.

ðŸ”§ What is a Plugin in Webpack?
A Webpack plugin is a JavaScript object that helps Webpack do extra tasks during the build process, 
such as:
- Generating HTML files
- Cleaning folders
- Copying assets
- Injecting variables
- Optimizing code
---

ðŸ›  Example Plugin Usage in Webpack
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: './index.html' })
]

âœ… What it does:
- Generates an HTML file in the `dist/` folder
- Automatically adds <script> tags for bundled JS
- Saves you from doing it manually

---

ðŸ¤” Why Arenâ€™t Plugins Included by Default?
Because not every project needs every feature.
Webpack is made to be:
- Flexible âœ…  
- Lightweight âœ…  
- Customizable âœ…  
So, you only install the plugins you actually need.
