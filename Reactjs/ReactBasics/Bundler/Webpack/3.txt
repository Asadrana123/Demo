webpack give us more control over how things will work

🔧 Core Tasks Performed by Parcel/Bundlers

📦 1. Module Bundling
Combines many JavaScript modules/files into fewer files (often just one for production).
Resolves import/require dependencies.

🔍 2. Dependency Resolution
Resolves file imports (JS, CSS, images, etc.).
Handles third-party libraries from node_modules.

📄 3. Asset Handling
Supports assets like:
Images (JPG, PNG, SVG, etc.)
Fonts (WOFF, TTF)
Media (MP4, MP3)

📚 4. Transpilation
Uses tools like Babel to convert modern JavaScript (ES6+, JSX) into backward-compatible JavaScript.
Enables use of features like:
JSX (for React)
Optional chaining
Arrow functions

🧵 5. CSS/SCSS Handling
Processes and bundles CSS or SCSS files.
Supports:
PostCSS
CSS Modules
Autoprefixing for cross-browser compatibility

🎨 6. HTML Processing
Parses HTML files, rewrites asset paths (e.g., images or scripts).
Supports dynamic insertion of scripts/styles into index.html.

🔁 7. Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
Replaces updated modules in the browser without a full reload.
Speeds up development workflow.

⚡ 8. Development Server
Starts a local HTTP server.
Watches for file changes and reloads automatically.

🧹 9. Tree Shaking
Removes unused code during the build to reduce bundle size.

🧽 10. Minification
Minifies JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to reduce file size.
Removes whitespace, comments, and shortens variable names.

✂️ 11. Code Splitting
Splits code into multiple chunks for faster load times.
Enables lazy loading (e.g., only load a page component when needed).

🔐 12. Environment Variable Injection
Injects .env variables into your app.

Differentiates between dev and prod builds.

📁 13. Output Management
Writes compiled files into a dist/ or build/ directory.
Supports cache-busting with hashed filenames.

✅ 14. Source Map Generation
Generates source maps to help debug minified code.

🧪 15. Plugin System
Allows custom behavior via plugins (e.g., TypeScript, GraphQL, Pug, etc.).

🌐 16. Browser Compatibility Handling
Adds polyfills for older browsers (if configured).
Ensures your app works across different environments.
