4. Plugins (Extra Functionality)
   Add extra features like HTML generation, minification, cleaning folders, etc.
   Example:
   plugins: [
     new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: './index.html' })
   ]

5. Mode Control
   Tells Webpack whether to optimize for development or production.
   Example:
   mode: 'development' // or 'production'

6. Dev Server Control
   Configures the local development server for hot reload, port, etc.
   Example:
   devServer: {
     port: 3000,
     hot: true,
     open: true
   }

Summary:
Webpack gives full control over how your app is built: starting point (entry), output location, 
handling different file types (loaders), adding extra features (plugins),
development or production mode, and local dev server behavior.
