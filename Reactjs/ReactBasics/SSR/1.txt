SSR:-
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique where your React app 
(or any JavaScript framework) runs on a backend server to generate HTML for a page 
before sending it to the user's browser.

Normal (Client-Side Rendering): The browser downloads a mostly empty HTML file, loads JavaScript, 
and then renders the page.

SSR: The server renders the page’s HTML in advance and sends this “pre-built” HTML to the browser.
This means users see content faster.

Key points:
SSR improves initial load time and SEO, since the HTML is ready before JavaScript runs.
React components run both "on the server" (while generating HTML) and "in the browser" 
(as interactive JavaScript).
