Steps That Are Officially Documented:
1. Update Still Gets Queued ✅ Official
The setState() call still enqueues the change

React doesn't check for equality at the time you call setState

2. Component Will Re-render (At Least Once) ✅ Official
React will still trigger a re-render to process the update

This happens because React needs to run the update to determine the final value

3. Comparison Happens ✅ Official
React compares the new state with previous state using Object.is comparison

This is reference equality for objects, value equality for primitives

4. Subsequent Re-renders Skipped ✅ Official
"If the next state is equal to the previous state, React will ignore your update"

No further re-renders will occur for that update
