 11. Run passive effects
useEffect A is pushed to the effect queue.
useEffect B is pushed to the effect queue.
React runs them in order:
🚀 Effect A: 0
🎈 Effect B: 0
Both schedule state updates:
setA(1) adds to hookA’s queue.
setB(1) adds to hookB’s queue.
✅ React marks the root Fiber as dirty again.


🔑 What does React mark as dirty?
1️⃣ The Fiber node for the component whose state changed

React sets fiber.flags |= Update on that specific Fiber.

This marks that component (and its subtree) for re-render.

2️⃣ The root Fiber is also marked
React sets root.pendingLanes |= lane — this means:
“The whole tree might need work, starting from the root.”
✅ So:
Both get marked:
🔹 The specific component’s Fiber → tells React where the change happened.
🔹 The root Fiber → tells the Scheduler there’s work to schedule.
👉 In short:
