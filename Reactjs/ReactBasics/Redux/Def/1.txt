**Redux Mastery - Step 1: What is Redux?**

- **Definition:** Redux is a standalone state management library that holds app state in a 
single store and updates it via actions and reducers, 
usable with any UI (React, Vue, Angular, plain JS).
It’s for predictable, centralized state and time‑travel/debug tooling; not tied to React by itself.

- **Problem It Solves:**  
  Managing shared state in React can get messy:
  - useState & props only work well for local state
  - Passing state and update functions through many components is cumbersome
  - Example: A shopping cart needs to be displayed in the header, cart page, and updated from multiple 
  pages

- **Redux Solution:**  
  - Central **store** holds all important app data  
  - Any component can:
    - Read data from the store  
    - Send updates to the store  
    - React to data changes automatically  

- **When to Use Redux:**  
  - Complex state shared across many components  
  - State needs to persist across page navigation  
  - Predictable state updates are required
