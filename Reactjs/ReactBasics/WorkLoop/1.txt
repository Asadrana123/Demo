📌 1️⃣ What is the “work loop”?
The work loop is the core engine of React Fiber.
It’s a while loop that processes units of work (Fiber nodes) one at a time.
The loop runs during the Render Phase, not Commit.

📌 2️⃣ Why does it exist?
In React’s old stack reconciler (before Fiber), rendering was synchronous — React could not pause rendering once started.

The work loop is what enables incremental rendering:
React can split work into small chunks.
It can pause, yield, and resume if higher priority work comes in.
This is how Concurrent Mode works.


✅ 3️⃣ What exactly is a “unit of work”?
A unit of work is a Fiber node:

while (nextUnitOfWork !== null && shouldYield() === false) {
  nextUnitOfWork = performUnitOfWork(nextUnitOfWork)
}
Each unit represents one Fiber:
e.g., a <div>, a <Button>, or a whole child subtree.
