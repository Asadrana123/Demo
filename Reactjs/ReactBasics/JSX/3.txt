Why is root.render(<Children />) correct but not root.render(Children)?
1. Children is a component function (or class), NOT an element
Children alone refers to the component itself (a function or class), not the JSX element.

root.render expects a React element, which is the result of calling that component or JSX.

2. <Children /> creates a React element
Writing <Children /> is JSX syntax that tells React:
“Call the Children function, create an element from its output.”

This creates a React element object that React DOM can render.

3. What happens if you do root.render(Children)?
You’re passing the component itself (a function), not an element.

React DOM does not know how to render a function directly.

This causes an error
