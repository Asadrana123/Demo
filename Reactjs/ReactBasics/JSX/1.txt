✅ 1️⃣ What is JSX?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.

It’s a syntax extension for JavaScript —
not a new language — 
that lets you write UI code that looks like HTML directly inside your JavaScript.

Example:

const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
Looks like HTML?
It’s not HTML.
It’s just syntax that tools like Babel transform into plain JavaScript.

✅ 2️⃣ Why does JSX exist?
JSX makes writing UI easier and clearer because:

Writing UI in pure React.createElement calls is ugly:

const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, JSX!');
But with JSX, you write:


const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
It feels more declarative: “What should the UI look like?”
It’s closer to how HTML works, which web devs already understand.

✅ 3️⃣ Is JSX required?
No!
React does not need JSX.
JSX is just syntactic sugar for React.createElement.

This:
<App name="Asad">Hello!</App>
is equivalent to:


React.createElement(App, { name: 'Asad' }, 'Hello!');
Your browser never sees JSX.
Your build tools (like Babel) convert it to JS.
