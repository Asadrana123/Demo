ðŸ”¹ What Are Props in React?
Props (short for properties) are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component.

function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
}

<Welcome name="Alice" />


ðŸ”¹ Props Are Immutable
Props should never be mutated. They are immutable from the perspective of the child component.



1.React does shallow comparison between memoizedProps and pendingProps means for primitive values
like string, numbers it compare by value but for object,arrays it compare by reference
not deep structure.

2. The main reason is that mutating props is a bad practice because it will not re-render the component.
