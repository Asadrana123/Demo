1. Virtual DOM nodes are simple plain JS objects
They just describe the UI: type, props, children, key, etc.

No heavy browser-specific properties or methods.

No event listeners, styles, layout info, or rendering data.

2. Real DOM nodes are complex browser objects
Each real DOM node is a full browser-native object (HTMLElement, TextNode, etc.)

They hold a lot of extra info: styles, layout, event handlers, rendering state, 
pointers to parent/child/sibling nodes, and more.

They are tightly integrated with the browserâ€™s rendering engine and memory management.
