✅ 3️⃣ What’s actually inside a Virtual DOM node?
Each node is a plain JS object, called a React Element.
It looks like this (simplified):

{
  $$typeof: Symbol(react.element),
  type: 'div',
  key: null,
  ref: null,
  props: {
    children: [ ... ],
    className: 'container',
    onClick: ...
  },
  _owner: FiberNode
}
