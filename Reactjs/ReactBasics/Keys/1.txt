Keys decide DOM node reuse. React still updates children/props of that node if they are different.

Learning React Key Props - Step by Step
Step 1: What Are Key Props and Why Do They Exist?
Let's start with the fundamentals. Key props are special attributes in React 
that help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed when
 working with lists of elements.

The Simple Explanation
Think of key props like name tags at a party. When people arrive or leave the party, 
you can quickly identify who's new, who left, and who's still there by looking at their name tags. 
Without name tags, you'd have to check everyone's face individually, which takes much longer.

Why React Needs Keys
When React renders a list of elements, it needs to figure out:

Which items are new?

Which items were removed?

Which items just moved to a different position?

Which items stayed the same but their content changed?

Without keys, React has to guess, and it often guesses wrong, leading to:

Performance issues (unnecessary re-renders)

Bugs (wrong components getting updated)

Lost component state (input fields losing focus, form data disappearing)
