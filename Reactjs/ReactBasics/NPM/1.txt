What happens when you run `npm install` and why so many files/folders appear:

🧠 1. What happens:
- `npm install` reads your `package.json` and downloads all listed dependencies (and their dependencies too).
- It installs them into a folder called `node_modules`.
- It also creates or updates the `package-lock.json` file to lock exact versions.

📁 2. Why so many files/folders?
- Every package (like `react`, `express`, etc.) may depend on many other packages.
- Each of those sub-packages can have their own dependencies.
- All these are saved inside `node_modules` — so it gets very large.

📦 3. What’s inside these files/folders?
- Each folder inside `node_modules` is a package.
- Inside each package folder, you'll usually find:
  - `index.js` or the main code files
  - `package.json` (specific to that package)
  - README, LICENSE, etc.
  - Sometimes also `dist/` folders for built files

🛠 4. Why do we need them?
- Your project uses external libraries to save time and avoid writing everything from scratch.
- For example, instead of writing your own code to handle routing, you use `react-router-dom`.

🔁 5. Where are these used?
- When you `import` or `require` a module in your JavaScript/React code, Node.js or bundlers 
like Webpack look inside `node_modules` to find and include the necessary files.

🧼 6. Can I delete `node_modules`?
- Yes, you can delete it any time.
- But if you do, run `npm install` again to recreate it.

Summary:
`npm install` brings your project to life by downloading the tools (dependencies) it needs to run or build correctly.
