what is the difference between dom mutation and dom manipulation

DOM Manipulation
Definition: The action performed by a developer (or code) to change the DOM.

Who/What does it?: You, your script, or the browser’s own logic.

Examples:
Adding, removing, or editing HTML elements using JavaScript methods like appendChild(),
removeChild(), setAttribute(), or innerHTML.
Analogy: Pushing a book onto a shelf—the act of moving the book.

DOM Mutation
Definition: The result or effect—the actual change that appears in the DOM after manipulation.

Who/What notices it?: Observers (like the browser, or tools like MutationObserver) that can “see”
that something in the DOM just changed.

Examples:
The element has been added, removed, or updated, and this change occurs in the webpage’s underlying
DOM structure.

Analogy: The shelf now has a new book—the state of the shelf after you’ve moved a book.
