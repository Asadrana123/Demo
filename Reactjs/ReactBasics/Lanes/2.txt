✅ 📌 4️⃣ Where does this live?
Each Fiber root (the top-level tree) has:


root.pendingLanes       // all lanes with pending work
root.suspendedLanes     // lanes that are currently suspended
root.pingedLanes        // lanes that were suspended but can retry
root.expiredLanes       // lanes that timed out


✅ 📌 5️⃣ How does React use it?
🔁 During scheduling:

React looks at all pendingLanes in the root.

Picks the highest priority lane(s) to work on.

If it needs to pause work (e.g., user does something urgent), lower-priority lanes can be paused.
