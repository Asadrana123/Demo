✅ 📌 1️⃣ What are “lanes” in React Fiber?
Definition:
A lane is a bit field (bitmask) that represents a priority level for updates.


🔑 Why do lanes exist?
React’s Fiber architecture is all about scheduling.

It allows multiple updates (setState, concurrent renders, transitions) to be tracked independently.

Different updates may have different priorities (e.g., typing vs. a background image load).
