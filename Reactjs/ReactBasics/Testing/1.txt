Step 1: Understand What "Testing" Means
Testing in programming is the practice of checking, automatically by code, whether your software works 
as expected.

Why Test Code?
To catch bugs early before users see them.

To make sure changes or new features don’t break existing code.

To give you confidence that your app works every time you update it.

For React Apps Specifically
You can test components to make sure they render correctly and respond to user actions properly.

You can test logic (functions, hooks) to make sure your data and rules work as expected.

Example (not code yet, just concept):
Imagine you wrote a function that adds two numbers. Testing means you write code that checks:
“If I give it 1 and 2, do I get 3 as the result?”

Sorts of Things You Might Test Later:
Does a button show up on the page?

Does clicking the button increase a counter?

Does submitting a form validate the input data correctly?
