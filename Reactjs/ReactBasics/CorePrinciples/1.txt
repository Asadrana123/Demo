1. Unidirectional Data Flow
Data flows from parent to child via props â€” not the other way.

2. Declarative Programming
Describe what you want, React handles how to update the UI.

3. Component-Based Architecture
UI is built using isolated, reusable components.

4. Immutability
State and props should not be mutated directly. Helps with predictable re-renders.

5. Virtual DOM & Efficient Reconciliation
React uses a virtual DOM and diffs it for optimal UI updates.
