✅ 1️⃣ What is Fiber?

Fiber is the new reconciliation engine in React (introduced in React 16).
It’s an algorithm + data structure that makes rendering interruptible, incremental, and prioritized.
Before Fiber, React’s render was stack-based and synchronous — big updates blocked the main thread.


When React’s render was stack-based and synchronous, it did everything at once, without pausing.

So, if rendering took a long time, JavaScript’s main thread was fully busy with React’s 
work — nothing else could run (no user clicks, no animations, no other JS).

Blocked main thread = browser can’t respond to user actions until React finishes rendering.


The main thread is the single thread in the browser that runs your JavaScript, 
renders the UI, and handles user events (clicks, scrolls, typing).

If it’s busy, the page feels frozen because nothing else can run at the same time.
