✅ 2️⃣ What is Concurrent Rendering?
Definition:
A rendering mode where React can:
Work on multiple versions of your UI simultaneously
Pause work, switch to something urgent, resume later
Why? 👉 Makes complex UIs more responsive → heavy renders don’t block user input.

🔹 Classic React (before Fiber)
Rendering was synchronous:
State update → React would render whole tree in one go.
Large trees could block the main thread → UI jank.

🔹 Fiber enables Concurrent Rendering
React Fiber breaks rendering into units of work (like tasks).
React does some units → checks if it should yield (pause) → does more later.
Example:
User types while expensive re-render runs:
Classic React: input freezes.
Concurrent: React pauses low-priority work → runs high-priority input → resumes rendering.
