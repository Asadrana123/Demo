✅ 4️⃣ How does Fiber enable interruptible work?
Core idea:

Fiber splits rendering work into units of work.

Each unit is a Fiber Node.

React can pause after a unit, let the browser handle urgent tasks (like input), then continue.



| Phase            | What happens                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Render phase** | Builds a **work-in-progress Fiber tree**. Can be paused. Pure calculations only — no DOM changes. |
| **Commit phase** | Applies the changes to the real DOM. Synchronous. Can’t be interrupted.                           |
