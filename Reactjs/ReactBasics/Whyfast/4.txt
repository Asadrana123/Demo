✅ 1️⃣ What is the Diffing Algorithm?
Definition:
The diffing algorithm is the core part of Reconciliation that
compares the previous virtual DOM tree and the new virtual DOM tree to figure out:

“What exactly changed?”

React uses this to compute the minimal set of DOM operations needed to update the UI.
