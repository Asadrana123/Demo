🟢 2️⃣ React Fiber Tree

What it is:

The Fiber Tree is the full linked structure made up of many Fiber nodes.

It represents your whole React component tree, but in Fiber format.

This tree lets React do:

Reconciliation: compare old vs new

Scheduling: split rendering into units

Commit phase: know exactly what changed

✅ Think: “Fiber Tree = all the units of work connected together to represent your UI.”
