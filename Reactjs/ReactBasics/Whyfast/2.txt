The core steps of Reconciliation
When React needs to update the UI:

1️⃣ Trigger: State or props change → component re-renders.
2️⃣ New Virtual DOM: React calls your function/component again → produces a new virtual DOM tree.
3️⃣ Compare: React compares the new tree to the old tree (diffing).
4️⃣ Compute changes: React figures out what parts of the real DOM need:

Added
Removed
Updated
Moved

5️⃣ Commit changes: React updates the real DOM to match the new virtual DOM.
