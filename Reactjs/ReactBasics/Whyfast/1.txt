✅ 1️⃣ What exactly is Reconciliation?
Definition:
Reconciliation is React’s internal process of figuring out how to update 
the UI efficiently when state or props change.

✅ 2️⃣ Why is Reconciliation needed?
The DOM is expensive to read/write.
Instead of making changes blindly, React:
Keeps a virtual DOM in memory.
When data changes, it:
Creates a new virtual DOM tree.
Compares it to the previous virtual DOM tree.
Calculates the smallest possible set of changes.
Applies these changes to the real DOM in the browser.
