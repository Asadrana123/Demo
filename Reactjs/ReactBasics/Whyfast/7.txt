✅ 2️⃣ Why was Fiber needed?

| Old Stack Reconciler             | Fiber                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Updates are synchronous          | Updates can be paused, split into chunks |
| No priorities                    | Updates can have priority levels         |
| Can’t abort or reuse work        | Can stop work & continue later           |
| Poor for animations/interactions | Smooth UIs possible                      |


✅ 3️⃣ What is a Fiber Node?

A Fiber Node is:

A JS object representing each element in your React tree.

Like a linked list node — each has:

type: What type of component it is (DOM node, class, function)

stateNode: The actual instance (like DOM element or class instance)

child: First child fiber

sibling: Next sibling fiber

return: Parent fiber

pendingProps & memoizedProps: New vs. last props

alternate: Link to the old fiber (for diffing)

✅ So the entire React tree is now a linked Fiber tree
