Where is the state stored during Reconciliation?
useState values live in Reactâ€™s fiber tree.

Each fiber node represents a part of your UI (element/component).
During Reconciliation:
React reuses the fiber tree.
Each fiber tracks its state, props, effects, etc.
When changes are detected, fibers mark what needs to change in the DOM.
