✅ What “batching” means
👉 React collects multiple state updates that happen in the same event loop tick,
and applies them all in one render, so the UI only updates once.

This improves performance and consistency.

“Same event loop tick” means all the state updates run in the same synchronous block of code,
before the JS engine goes back to the event loop to pick the next task.
