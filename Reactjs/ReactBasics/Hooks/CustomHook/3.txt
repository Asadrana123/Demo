Most basic differences

React component

Name starts with UPPER-case letter (e.g., TodoList).
Used inside JSX like <TodoList />.
Returns JSX or null.
Gets its own React fiber and can display UI.
Custom hook

Name starts with use (e.g., useTodos).

Called like a normal function inside a component.
May call other hooks (useState, useEffect, …).
Returns data or functions—never JSX.
Shares the caller component’s fiber (no UI of its own).
Plain helper function
Any name that doesn’t follow the two patterns.
Called anywhere (component, hook, or other code).
Cannot call React hooks; only pure JavaScript logic
