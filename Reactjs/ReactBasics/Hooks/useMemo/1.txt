What is useMemo?
useMemo is a React Hook that serves as a memoization mechanism for expensive computations. 
At its core, it's a performance optimization tool that caches the result of a computation and only
recalculates it when specific dependencies change.

The Core Problem useMemo Solves
Before understanding the solution, you need to grasp the fundamental problem:

React's Re-rendering Behavior: Every time a component re-renders 
(due to state changes, prop updates, or parent re-renders), all the code inside that component function 
runs again. This includes:

Variable declarations
Function calls
Complex calculations
Object/array creations
