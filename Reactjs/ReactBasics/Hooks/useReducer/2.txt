Syntax:-
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
Meaning of the Terms

reducer:A function you write that receives the current state and an action, 
and returns the next state.
It looks like this:

function reducer(currentState, action) {
  // Logic to compute and return the next state
}


initialState:
The value you want your state to start with (just like the first argument to useState).
This can be anything: a number, an object, an array, etc.

state:
The current value of the state, which is always produced by your reducer.
You use it in your component to decide what to render.

dispatch:
A function you call to send an "action" to the reducer.
For example:
dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" });
dispatch({ type: "ADD_TODO", payload: "Read docs" });
