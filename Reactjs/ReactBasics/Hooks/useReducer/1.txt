What is useReducer?
useReducer is a state management tool for React components.
It lets you manage complex state by using a function called a reducer.
Instead of updating state directly with a setter (like setState or setCount), you send an "action" to 
the reducer, and it decides how to update the state.

why useReducer:-
Switch to useReducer when you have complex, related state, multiple ways to update state, 
the need for organized logic, or want easier scalability and testing.
