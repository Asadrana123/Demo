Dispatch function:-
The dispatch function created by React’s useReducer isn’t something you write yourself—it’s
generated by React behind the scenes. Here’s how it works conceptually and what it might look 
like internally:

How dispatch Works Internally
When you call dispatch(action), React:
Takes the current state and the action you provided.
Calls your reducer(state, action) function.
Sets the new state to what the reducer returns.
Schedules a re-render so your UI updates with the new state.
A simplified implementation of what dispatch might look like (conceptually, not actual React code):

function useReducer(reducer, initialState) {
  let state = initialState;

  function dispatch(action) {
    state = reducer(state, action);
    // React handles scheduling a component update here
    renderComponentWithUpdatedState(state);
  }

  return [state, dispatch];
}
