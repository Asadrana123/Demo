ðŸ§  Key Idea:
React may render more than one thing at the same time 
(like new page preparing in background).
To avoid bugs, it needs a separate value for this â€” that's what _currentValue2 is for.

You donâ€™t need to manage this.

âœ… For you as a developer:
<MyContext.Provider value="Asad">
  <App />
</MyContext.Provider>


React will decide:
Use _currentValue if rendering normally
Use _currentValue2 if rendering concurrently
You don't need to worry about managing them.
