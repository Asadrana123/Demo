API (Application Programming Interface) is:
A set of functions, objects, methods, or rules that a software library or system exposes 
so other code can interact with it.
Examples:
In React, useState, useEffect, createContext â€” all are part of React's API.
In JavaScript, Math.random() is part of the Math API.
So an API can include functions. It's not a separate thing â€” 
it's the interface (set of accessible features)

âœ… Step 1 â€” What is React Context?
ðŸ“Œ Definition:
React Context is a built-in API that lets you share values between components 
without explicitly passing props through every level of the component tree.

This creates a Context object with two main parts:
MyContext.Provider
MyContext.Consumer (used internally by useContext);


ðŸ”Ž What is inside MyContext?
Itâ€™s an object with these main properties:
{
  $$typeof: Symbol(react.context),         // internal React type
  _currentValue: ...,                      // current context value (used in legacy mode)
  _currentValue2: ...,                     // current value (used in concurrent mode)
  Provider: { $$typeof: Symbol(react.provider), ... },  // React component for providing context
  Consumer: { $$typeof: Symbol(react.context), ... },   // Legacy way to consume context
  displayName: undefined or string         // optional name for debugging
}

Why Symbol.for(react.context) :-
In large apps, bundlers like Webpack may include multiple 
React versions (e.g., app vs. library).
If React used Symbol('react.context'), then:
React in app and React in library would create different Symbols
Even though both say "react.context", React wouldn't recognize it
ðŸ”¥ Breaks features like context, elements, etc.
âœ… With Symbol.for('react.context'), both versions pull the same global Symbol, 
so they stay in sync



Why are there two context values: _currentValue and _currentValue2?
âœ… The clean answer (no confusion):
| Name             | Used when                  | Why it exists                                                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_currentValue`  | **Normal (old) React**     | For synchronous rendering (everything at once)                        |
| `_currentValue2` | **New React (Concurrent)** | For advanced rendering (like background rendering, transitions, etc.) |
