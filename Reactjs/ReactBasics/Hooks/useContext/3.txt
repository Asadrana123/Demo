✅ displayName is used only for debugging purposes — especially in React DevTools.

const UserContext = React.createContext();
UserContext.displayName = "MyUserContext";

Then in React DevTools, you will see:
<MyUserContext.Provider>

When you have many contexts, displayName helps you:
Know which context you’re looking at
Avoid confusion in deeply nested trees
