propagateContextChange() is an internal React function.

Its actual work:
Triggered when context value changes in <Context.Provider>.

Walks the fiber tree downward from the provider.
Finds all context consumers (subscribed fibers) under that provider.
Marks them as needing re-render if they consume the changed context value.
ðŸ‘‰ It ensures only affected consumers are re-rendered, not the whole subtree.
