what is ResizeObserver in DOM:-
ResizeObserver is a modern JavaScript API that allows you to efficiently monitor changes 
to the size of specific DOM elements, not just the window. It provides notifications whenever an element's 
content or border box changes dimensions, enabling responsive behaviors and dynamic layouts beyond what CSS 
media queries or window resize events offer.

Key Concepts:

Instead of listening to the global window resize event (which only detects browser viewport changes),
ResizeObserver lets you watch size changes on any individual element, including those caused by dynamic content, 
layout shifts, or style changes.

Useful for responsive design, adaptive components, and scalable content where element sizes can change 
independently of the viewport.
