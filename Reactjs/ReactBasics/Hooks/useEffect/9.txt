👉 Memory leak:
When your app keeps holding on to memory it no longer needs, 
instead of letting the JavaScript engine clean it up (garbage collection).

✅ In React example:
If you add an event listener (e.g., window.addEventListener) 
in useEffect but don’t remove it in cleanup, the listener 
stays active even if the component unmounts → the memory for 
that listener can’t be freed → memory keeps growing → app slows down over time.

✔️ So:
Always clean up side effects like subscriptions, timers, or listeners to avoid memory leaks.
