✅ 3️⃣ When does useEffect run?
By default:

After every render where its dependencies have changed.
Key: It runs after the paint, not during render → so it won’t block the UI.


Basic syntax:-

useEffect(() => {
  // ✅ Effect logic here
  return () => {
    // ✅ Cleanup logic here (runs before next effect or on unmount)
  };
}, [dependencies]);
