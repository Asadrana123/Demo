🟢 1️⃣ What is componentWillUnmount?

It’s a React class component lifecycle method.

Runs right before the component is removed from the DOM.

Gives you a chance to clean up side effects → to prevent memory leaks, 
dangling timers, or open subscriptions.


🟢 2️⃣ When does it run?

| Phase   | Runs?                                                |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Mount   | ❌                                                    |
| Update  | ❌                                                    |
| Unmount | ✅ Runs once, right before the component is destroyed |




When your component is removed, you should:
✅ Clear timers
✅ Remove event listeners
✅ Close WebSocket connections
✅ Abort network requests
✅ Cancel subscriptions

Otherwise, those things keep running in memory, causing:
Bugs
Memory leaks
Wasted CPU/bandwidth
