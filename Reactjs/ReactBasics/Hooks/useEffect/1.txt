✅ 1️⃣ What is useEffect?


useEffect is a React Hook for running side effects after your component renders.
Side effect = any logic that reaches outside React’s render output
e.g., fetch data, subscribe to an event, manipulate DOM directly, timers, logs, etc.


“Outside React’s render output” means anything that doesn’t directly 
produce the UI markup (the JSX/DOM).

Examples:

Fetching data from an API 🗂️
Setting up a timer ⏰
Subscribing to a WebSocket 📡
Manually changing the DOM 🖌️

👉 These actions affect things outside the React virtual DOM render process —
 so they’re called side effects.
