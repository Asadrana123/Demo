✅ 6️⃣ What does the cleanup function do?

Before the effect runs again (for the previous effect).
and when component unmount.
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Subscribe to chat room:", roomId);

  return () => {
    console.log("Cleanup: Unsubscribe from room:", roomId);
  };
}, [roomId]);





👉 In React, the cleanup for each useEffect always runs immediately before its own effect 
runs again — BUT when there are multiple effects, they are batched in a 
single passive effects phase, so all cleanups run first, then all effects run.
