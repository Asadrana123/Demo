ðŸ‘‰ Direct state update:

It takes a snapshot of the state value (like count) at the time your code runs.

The count + 1 is evaluated immediately, so the actual setCount() stores that fixed number.

This value is frozen, does NOT react to later changes.

ðŸ‘‰ Functional state update:

It takes a snapshot of the function you provide.

The function itself is stored in Reactâ€™s update queue.

Later, during render, React executes that function with the latest up-to-date state from the Fiber tree.

So the function always runs on the fresh value, not the stale closure.
