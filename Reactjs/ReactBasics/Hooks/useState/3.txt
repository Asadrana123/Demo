2️⃣ Updating state causes a re-render
When you call setState:

React schedules a re-render.
Your component runs again with the new state.


3️⃣ useState is asynchronous
State updates don’t happen immediately:
You cannot read the new state immediately after calling setState in the same run.
React batches state updates for performance.
