Step 1: In-Depth Technical Understanding—useLayoutEffect in the React Commit Lifecycle
Synchronous Execution Context
useLayoutEffect fires synchronously after the DOM is updated but before the browser
paints the screen. This phase is called the "layout effect" phase and is distinct from the 
standard "effect" phase (useEffect).

All browser layout operations triggered in useLayoutEffect (e.g., measurements, mutations)
are completed before the user can see the result. This ensures the UI the user sees reflects 
any urgent adjustments you make—no flicker, no visual tearing, no incorrect measurements.

Technical Sequence
Render Phase: React builds the virtual DOM tree.

Commit Phase: The virtual DOM is reconciled with the real DOM.

useLayoutEffect Callbacks: Run after the DOM is mutated but before the next paint.
All child component layout effects run before moving to parents (bottom-up).

Browser Paint: The browser paints the updated UI.

useEffect Callbacks: Fired after painting.

React’s Intent
React gives you this hook to allow synchronous, post-DOM but pre-paint manipulations—something that’s
crucial for advanced UI concerns like animation, focus management, scrollers, or any scenario where
layout reads and immediate DOM mutations must happen before the next frame.



Use Cases:-
Preventing Layout Shift and Flicker
Updating state based on measurements, and then re-rendering to adjust positions/dimensions before the 
browser paints, avoiding intermediate/incorrect UI states visible to users.


2. Scroll Management: Auto-Scroll to Bottom (e.g., Chat App)
Auto-scroll to the latest message immediately after new messages render so users always
see the newest content.

import React, { useRef, useLayoutEffect } from "react";

function Chat({ messages }) {
  const bottomRef = useRef(null);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    if (bottomRef.current) {
      bottomRef.current.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "auto" });
    }
  }, [messages]);
  
  return (
    <div style={{ height: 200, overflow: 'auto' }}>
      {messages.map((msg, idx) => <div key={idx}>{msg}</div>)}
      <div ref={bottomRef} />
    </div>
  );
}


3. Preventing Layout Shift: Synchronize Columns’ Height
When you want two columns to always stay the same height—measure both and set the
max height right after DOM updates, so there’s no visible jump.

Conclusion:-
Use useLayoutEffect for DOM interactions where timing is critical (layout reads, sync writes, 
preventing flicker/layout jump).
