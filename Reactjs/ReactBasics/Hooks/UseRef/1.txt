What is the ref property?
It’s a special React property on Fiber nodes and elements.
Holds a reference object or callback function passed from your JSX via ref={...}.
Used to link React elements or fibers to external mutable values 
(usually DOM nodes or class instances).

Not all Fiber nodes contain refs, but some do depending on the type:
HostComponent Fibers (e.g., <div>, <input>) can have refs because they correspond to 
real DOM elements.
ClassComponent Fibers can have refs, as class instances can be referenced.
FunctionComponent Fibers generally do not have refs attached directly 
(since function components don’t have instances).
Other Fiber types like HostText, Suspense, etc., typically do not hold refs.



Internals of ref
On a Fiber node, ref is a field:
fiber.ref = refObject | refCallback | null;
