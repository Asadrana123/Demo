1️⃣ What is useRef?
useRef is a React Hook that returns a mutable ref object.
This object has a .current property that persists across renders.
Changing .current does not trigger a re-render.
It’s like a “box” to store a value that React won’t track for rendering.


3️⃣ Primary uses of useRef
🔹 Store a DOM node reference
function Example() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const focusInput = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus(); // direct DOM method call
  };

  return <input ref={inputRef} />;
}
