✅Fiber Architecture:-
Fiber Architecture is React’s complete reimplementation of its reconciliation algorithm 
introduced in React 16. It breaks rendering work into small units called fibers, enabling React 
to pause, resume, and prioritize rendering tasks. This allows for incremental and concurrent 
rendering, which improves app responsiveness and enables features like time-slicing and Suspense.
In short, Fiber Architecture helps React handle complex UI updates efficiently without blocking 
the main thread.
