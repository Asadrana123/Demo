3. The "Minimal Parameters" Rule
Principle: Functions should require the minimum information necessary to do their job

Remember: Every parameter you add makes the function harder to:

Use correctly
Test thoroughly
Understand quickly
Refactor safely

Apply This By: For each parameter, ask "Is this absolutely necessary, or can I derive/calculate 
this inside the function?"

4. The "Single Source of Truth" Principle
Principle: Don't make the caller responsible for maintaining data consistency

Remember: Your function signature was forcing callers to:

Find the right array reference
Pass the correct ID
Keep track of which array belongs to which comment

Apply This By: If your function needs multiple pieces of related data, 
accept a simple identifier and look up the rest internally.
