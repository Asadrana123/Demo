Expanded “No Need for Custom Hook” List
1. One-off State
Just a single value, only used in one simple component.

jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>;
}
2. UI-Only Components
Your component only displays stuff—it doesn’t handle any logic or change state.

jsx
function InfoCard({ title, description }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
3. Calculation or Helper Functions
Just write a regular function. No state, no React features.

jsx
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
4. Logic Used Only Once
If your logic isn’t duplicated, just leave it in the component.

jsx
function ProfileEdit() {
  // logic only needed here
}
5. Very Basic useEffect
You have a simple side effect used once and specific to this component.

jsx
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = "Profile Page";
}, []);
No need for a hook unless several components set document titles!

6. Styling State
If you are controlling simple visual state (like hover with CSS), don’t make a hook—just use CSS or component props.

7. Temporary, “Quick and Dirty” Logic
If you’re prototyping or experimenting, don’t worry about hooks unless things get bigger.

8. Only Rendering Props
If your component only displays props and doesn’t change anything, it’s just UI.

9. No React Code at All
If you have code that doesn’t use useState, useEffect, or other React stuff, don’t try to make a hook.

10. Logic Too Tied to UI
If your logic is specific to just how you show something (like a custom animation), it’s better as a component not a hook.

11. Premature Optimization
Don’t create a hook just because you “might” reuse logic in the future.
Wait until you actually need it in more than one place.

Easy Rule:
If your code is short, simple, and only needed in one spot, keep it in the component.
Make a custom hook only for messy, complex, or reused logic across multiple components.
