The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in ReactJS states that each component or function should 
have only one reason to change, meaning it should do one job and do it well.

Applying SRP to state management in React does not mean you must create a custom hook for every
component to handle its state logic. Instead, the principle encourages you to:

Make sure each component is responsible for a specific part of your UI, not for multiple, unrelated 
concerns.

Keep your state management and logic well-organized—sometimes that means extracting complex or 
reusable state logic into custom hooks, but not always.

Only create a custom hook when multiple components need to share the same logic, or when the 
logic becomes too complex to keep directly in the component.

For simple components, using useState or useReducer directly inside the component is fine and keeps 
things simple. For more advanced or reusable logic, a custom hook helps maintain separation and 
improves testability.

Example of SRP applied in React:

If a form component contains both UI rendering and state management for validation, 
consider splitting out the validation logic into a custom hook if it’s reused elsewhere. 
But if the state and logic are unique to the component and simple, you can keep it within that 
component.

Summary:

SRP means every component (and custom hook) should have a clear, single responsibility.

You should make a hook only if the state logic is complex or reused; you do not need a hook 
for every single component by default.

Focus on keeping components small, focused, and maintainable; use hooks in a way that supports
these goals.
