In the context of ReactJS, the SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) means that each component should have one 
clear responsibility or role. This is a core principle from SOLID design patterns that helps keep your code modular,
maintainable, and understandable.
What does SRP mean for React?
A component should do one thing, and do it well.

It should have only one reason to changeâ€”for example, a UI representation, or managing a specific 
piece of logic or state.

If a component starts doing more than one thing (e.g., fetching data and rendering UI and handling unrelated events),
it violates SRP.

SRP encourages you to split components and hooks so each piece handles just one concern,
making code easier to maintain and test.
