What is crossorigin?

When your website loads something (like a script) from another domain (like unpkg.com),
it’s called a cross-origin request.
Normally, browsers block access to some info (like errors) for security.
The crossorigin attribute tells the browser how to handle that request.


Why use crossorigin?
Without it:
If the script fails to load, you won’t see useful error messages in your browser console.
The browser treats it like an “anonymous” request and gives you limited info.
With crossorigin:

The browser says: “Hey, I want to load this from another site, but also get error info 
if something goes wrong.”
