Library:-
A library is a collection of pre-written code (functions, classes, utilities) 
that helps you perform common tasks — like working with arrays, making API requests, 
or building a UI — without writing that code yourself.


Package:-
A package is a bundle that contains:
The actual code (like a library),
And also some extra information (metadata) about that code:

Name
Version
Author
What other packages it needs
Entry point (main file)
License, etc.

You're installing the lodash package — which contains:
✅ The Lodash library code
✅ A package.json file (with version, name, etc.)
✅ Maybe docs, type definitions, or tests


Dependency:-
Dependencies are listed in package.json file and that are the list 
of packages which our projects need to run.
