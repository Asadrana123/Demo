You are in India (on your laptop), and you visit a website hosted in USA:
📍 Your Laptop (India) → 🌍 google.com Server (USA)

🗺️ High-Level Path Overview:

Laptop → Home Router → ISP → Undersea Cables → US ISP → Google Data Center → Google Server
Now let’s go layer by layer and hop by hop, including MAC, IP, DNS, NAT, and more.

🔁 FULL DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP BREAKDOWN
🔹 Step 0: You type www.google.com in browser
💡 At this point, your computer doesn’t even know Google’s IP yet.

🟨 Step 1: DNS Resolution (Find IP Address of Google)
Your computer sends a DNS query to your local DNS resolver (usually your ISP’s server).

That resolver may ask global DNS servers to find google.com's IP.

Eventually, it gets a response like:
www.google.com → 142.250.195.132

Now your PC knows where to send the HTTP request.

✅ DNS uses IP & MAC locally for communication.

🟨 Step 2: Building the HTTP Request
App Layer: Creates a request → GET / HTTP/1.1

Transport Layer (TCP): Adds port numbers

Network Layer (IP): Adds your source IP (192.168.1.2), destination IP (142.250.195.132)

Data Link Layer: Adds your MAC, and the router’s MAC as destination

✅ Now the full frame is ready to be sent.

🟨 Step 3: Your Laptop → Home Router
Layer	Address Used
IP	Source: 192.168.1.2, Dest: 142.250.195.132
MAC	Source: Laptop MAC, Dest: Router MAC

Your laptop sends the frame.

Router receives it.

Router reads the IP and says: "This is for outside the local network."

🟨 Step 4: NAT at the Router
Since you're using a Private IP, router:

Uses NAT (Network Address Translation)

Replaces source IP 192.168.1.2 with its Public IP (e.g., 49.37.88.7)

Keeps track of the session in a NAT table

🟨 Step 5: Router → ISP Network
Now the frame is sent to the next hop, the ISP gateway

New MAC addresses are used:

Source MAC = router

Destination MAC = ISP gateway

✅ IP address remains same (public), MAC address changes

🟨 Step 6: ISP → Backbone → Undersea Cable → US ISP
Your data travels across multiple routers using IP routing

At each router:

IP stays the same (Public source & destination)

MAC changes every hop (frame is rebuilt at each router)

✅ This is how the data crosses cities, countries, oceans 🌍
Some of these routers are in:

Local ISP

Regional ISP

Internet Backbone

US ISP (e.g., Comcast, Verizon)

🟨 Step 7: Reaches Google’s Data Center (USA)
Final packet reaches Google’s edge router

It forwards the packet to the internal network

Google’s internal router checks: “Ah, this IP belongs to my server rack!”

🟨 Step 8: Google Router → Google Server (LAN)
Google’s router looks up the MAC of the destination server using ARP

Frame is sent to the correct server (e.g., MAC = 22:33:44:55:66:77)

✅ IP is still 142.250.195.132, but now we’re using local MAC again.

🟨 Step 9: Google Server Responds
Server replies with HTTP response

Source IP: 142.250.195.132

Destination IP: 49.37.88.7 (your router’s public IP)

TCP ports included to match the session

The journey back begins 🔁
Each hop again:

IP remains constant

MAC keeps changing hop by hop

When your router receives it, NAT maps the response back to your PC (192.168.1.2).

🔄 Summary Table: Journey Stages
Step	From	To	IP Address Used	MAC Address Used
1	Laptop	Router	✅	✅
2	Router	ISP Gateway	✅	✅ (changes)
3	Routers Across Internet	Next router	✅	✅ (changes every hop)
4	US Router	Google Server	✅	✅
5	Google Server	Your Router	✅	✅
6	Your Router	Your Laptop	✅	✅

✅ Final Conclusion
✔️ Every message passes through multiple layers of network
✔️ At each hop:

IP address remains constant (for routing)

MAC address changes (for local delivery)
✔️ NAT converts private IP to public IP
✔️ DNS helps resolve domain names to IPs
✔️ Switches and NICs need MAC, Routers need IP
