What is a Private IP Address?
A Private IP address is an IP assigned to devices within a local network like:

Your home Wi-Fi
Office LAN
School computer lab
These IPs are not accessible from the internet directly.

Main Uses of Private IP Addresses
Identify devices within a local network

Example: Your phone, laptop, and printer all get different private IPs from your router.

Enable local communication between devices

For file sharing, printing, LAN gaming, etc.

Devices use the routerâ€™s public IP to connect to the internet.

Like smart TVs, Alexa, Wi-Fi bulbs, and CCTV cameras.
