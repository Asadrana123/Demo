 How Data Travels Between Two Devices Over the Internet
🧾 Your Understanding (Rephrased & Confirmed):
Step-by-Step:
🧑‍💻 Your Device (with Private IP)
For example:
Laptop (192.168.1.10) wants to visit www.google.com.

🌐 Your Router (with Public IP)
Your router has a public IP like 103.22.54.90 assigned by your ISP.

🔁 NAT (Network Address Translation)
Your router replaces the private IP in the outgoing packet with its public IP so it can go onto the internet.

🚀 Internet Routing
Routers on the internet use the public IP to deliver the request across many hops to the destination server/router.

🧭 At the Destination Side
The destination router (e.g., Google’s server) receives the request on its public IP, processes it,
 and prepares the response.

🔙 Back to Your Router
The response travels back to your router using your public IP.

🎯 Router Maps it Back to You
Using NAT, your router knows:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Response for 103.22.54.90 → send it to 192.168.1.10 (your laptop)
and delivers the message to your private IP device.

🧠 Summary Sentence:
The message travels over the internet using public IPs, and inside each local network, the router 
delivers it to the correct device using private IPs.
