What is a Public IP Address?
A Public IP address is an IP assigned to your network/router by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
It’s globally unique and visible on the internet.

It allows your home or office network to communicate with websites, apps, servers, etc. on the internet.

Typical Uses of Public IP
Access websites, YouTube, apps, etc.
→ Your device uses the public IP of the router to talk to the outside world.

Host servers and websites
→ If you want people to reach your service, your server needs a public IP.

Remote access
→ If you want to access your CCTV, PC, or IoT device from outside, you need a public IP or special 
configuration (like port forwarding).

Note: One Public IP = Many Devices Inside Network
This is called NAT (Network Address Translation).
That’s why:

Your whole home can access the internet using 1 public IP

Even if you have 10 devices inside your house
