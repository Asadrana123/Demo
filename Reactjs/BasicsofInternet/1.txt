There Are Two Ways Devices Connect:-
1. Wired LAN (using Ethernet cables)
Devices (like a PC, printer, smart TV) are connected with LAN cables (also called RJ45 or Ethernet cables).
All cables are plugged into a central device:
→ a router or a network switch.


2. Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi)
Devices connect without cables, using Wi-Fi signals.
All devices talk to one central device: the Wi-Fi router.
They still form a LAN even without wires!
