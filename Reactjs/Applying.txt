Greetings,

I saw the Linkedin job posting to fill the role of SDE. I'm interested in the job. 
It is something I'm passionate about. Rather than just sending you my CV, I decided to send
you my portfolio and source code. This work will hopefully show you why I would be a great
candidate for the job. My experience in full-stack development and real-time applications 
demonstrates my technical capabilities.

I have worked as a Software Developer at Rangi Lalls from August 2024 to Present, where I engineered 
full-stack auction platforms using MERN stack and implemented real-time WebSocket communication. 
Previously, I was a Software Developer Intern at Rangi Lalls from March 2024 to July 2024, and also 
served as a Teaching Assistant at Coding Ninjas for React.js and Data Structures & Algorithms from 
August 2023 to November 2023.

You can access my Portfolio and source cod

I was able to find the JD via,

I'd love to schedule a time to discuss my suitability for the role within the next fortnight.

Sincerely,
