^ in package.json means "compatible with version", allowing updates that do not change the leftmost non-zero digit. For example, "^1.2.3" allows versions from 1.2.3 up to but not including 2.0.0 (minor and patch updates allowed, no major).

Other version prefixes:

- ^ : Allows minor and patch updates (e.g., "^4.17.0" allows 4.17.x and 4.18.x but not 5.0.0)
- ~ : Allows only patch updates (e.g., "~4.17.0" allows 4.17.x only)
- No prefix : Exact version only (e.g., "4.17.0" only that version)
- * or x : Any version (e.g., "*" or "4.x" allows any version)
- >=, <=, >, < : Version ranges (e.g., ">=4.17.0")
;

Summary: ^ is most common as it safely allows non-breaking updates; ~ is stricter, only patch updates; no prefix means exact version.
