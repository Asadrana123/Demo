What is CDN?
CDN stands for Content Delivery Network.
It is a group of servers located around the world that store copies of website files (like images, videos, CSS, 
JS, etc.).

When a user opens a website, instead of loading all files from the main server (which could be far away),
the files are loaded from the nearest CDN server. This makes websites load faster, reduces server load, and improves performance for global users.
Benefits of a CDN:
Faster website loading
Better experience for users around the world
Less pressure on the main server
Higher reliability and uptime
Some CDNs offer security like DDoS protection
