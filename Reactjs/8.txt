What is a bundler in React?
A bundler is a tool that takes all your project files (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) and combines 
them into a few optimized files (called bundles) for the browser.


React apps use:
Many JS files and components
import/export (ES6 modules)
JSX (which the browser doesnâ€™t understand directly)

CSS modules, assets, etc.
ðŸ§  The browser canâ€™t handle all of that directly â€” so the bundler:
Compiles JSX to JavaScript.
Resolves imports between files.
Minifies & optimizes code.
Creates final output files the browser can understand.


the bundlers in react are :-
vite
webpack
parcel


webpack give us more control over how things will work
