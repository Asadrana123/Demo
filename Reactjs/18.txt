✅ Difference between `npx` and `npm`:

📦 `npm` (Node Package Manager):
- Used to **install**, **uninstall**, and **manage** packages.
- Example: `npm install create-react-app`
  → Installs `create-react-app` **into your project**.

🚀 `npx` (Node Package Execute):
- Used to **run a package directly** without installing it globally.
- Example: `npx create-react-app my-app`
  → Runs `create-react-app` **without permanently installing** it.

🧠 Summary:
- `npm` → installs packages.
- `npx` → executes packages temporarily (great for one-time use CLI tools).

💡 Tip:
- Use `npx` to avoid cluttering your system with globally installed tools.



✅ Where does `npx` add the package if not in `node_modules`?

📦 `npx` downloads the package to a **temporary cache folder**, NOT `node_modules`.

🗂 On most systems, it's stored in:
- Linux/macOS: `~/.npm/_npx/`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\npm-cache\_npx\`

🧹 After running the command:
- It deletes the temporary files (unless cached)
- So it won’t stay in your project folder

💡 That’s why you don’t see it in `node_modules` — it’s only used temporarily!

✅ What does "unless cached" mean in `npx`?

🧠 When you run a command with `npx`, it may **temporarily download the package**.

💾 If the same version of that package is already **stored (cached)** on your system from before, then `npx` will **reuse** it instead of downloading again.

📍 That cache is usually located at:
- macOS/Linux: `~/.npm/_npx/`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\npm-cache\_npx\`

🧹 After execution:
- The actual package code used by `npx` is removed from the temp folder.
- But the **npm cache** might still keep it for later use, saving download time.

💡 So "unless cached" means:
> If the package was already downloaded and stored earlier, it can be reused.
