React.createElement() — Structure:-
React.createElement(type, props, ...children)
const heading=React.createElement('h1',{name:"Asad"},'hello from react')
it returns an object that contains all infromation which we are passing to this function;
{
    $$typeof:Symbol(react.element)
    "type": "h1",   
    "key": null,
    "ref": null,
    "props": {
        "name": "Asad",
        "children": "hello from react"
    },
    "_owner": null,
    "_store": {}
}
 
$$typeof:Symbol(react.element)
this thing helps react to recognize that it is react element.
element.$$typeof === Symbol.for('react.element')
This avoids errors like:
❌ Rendering a regular object by mistake
❌ Crashing when a function or array is passed
