📦 Why Do We Need package-lock.json?
🧠 Think of it like this: Consistency & Safety for your project.

---

✅ 1. The Problem Without It:
If you install the same project on 2 computers:

- package.json says:
  "I need react ^18.0.0"
- That means:
  - One computer may install 18.2.0
  - Another may install 18.0.1

🔁 Result: Same project, but different versions — might cause bugs!

---

🔐 2. The Solution — package-lock.json:
It locks every single version like this:

- react: 18.2.0
- react-dom: 18.2.0
- All sub-packages and their versions too.

💡 This way, every machine installs **exactly** the same versions.
💯 Your app behaves the same for everyone.

📦 3. Why Is It Bigger?
Because it lists:
- All main dependencies
- All sub-dependencies (nested)
- Their exact versions
- Download URLs
- Integrity hashes (to verify files)

Example:
- `react` might depend on 3 other packages
- Each of those might depend on more
🔁 package-lock.json tracks the full tree!
