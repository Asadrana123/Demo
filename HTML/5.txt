Script tag
Q.Where can we place the <script> tag?
You can place it in two main locations:
✅ 1. Inside the <head> tag:
<head>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
⚠️ Not recommended unless necessary.
❌ Blocks the page from rendering until the script is loaded.
✅ 2. Before the closing </body> tag (recommended):
<body>
  <!-- content here -->
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
✅ The page loads first, then the script runs.
✅ Better for performance.

Q.What happens with async?
The browser starts parsing the HTML.
When it sees <script src="... async">, it:
Starts downloading the script in parallel (while continuing to parse HTML).
As soon as the script is downloaded, it pauses HTML parsing.
Then, it executes the script immediately.
After execution, it resumes parsing HTML.
Download happens in parallel with HTML.
⚠️ Execution happens immediately after download, which can interrupt HTML parsing.

Q.defer–Deferred Execution
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
Downloads the script in parallel with HTML parsing (like async).
Waits to execute the script until the entire HTML is fully parsed.
Scripts with defer are executed in the order they appear in the HTML.


async means:
→ “Download asynchronously, and execute asynchronously (immediately when done, without waiting for HTML).”
defer means:
→ “Download asynchronously, but defer execution until the entire HTML is parsed.”
