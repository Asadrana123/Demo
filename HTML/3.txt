Q.What is the <meta> Tag?
The <meta> tag is an HTML element used to provide metadata about the webpage.
Metadata is information about the data, which is not displayed on the page but helps browsers, 
search engines, and other tools understand your site better.

We write different meta tag for different purposes.
If you try to write everything in one <meta> tag, like this:
<meta charset="UTF-8" name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
The browser will only recognize one purpose, usually the first attribute (charset).

What is charset="UTF-8"?
The charset attribute in the <meta> tag defines the character encoding used to interpret the text on your 
web page. UTF-8 stands for "Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bits", and it is the most widely used character 
encoding on the web today and also It doesnâ€™t need name and content, because it's not sending nameâ€“value data.

Chrome knows its OS (like Android, iOS, Windows, etc.) because it's installed inside that OS.

This request includes a User-Agent string in the headers.
That User-Agent contains info about:
The browser
The operating system
The device type (mobile, desktop, etc.)
