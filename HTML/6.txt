Sementic tag:-
Tags in HTML that clearly describe their meaning or purpose in the context of web content. 
These tags make the structure of the web page understandable both to browsers (for correct rendering) 
and developers (for readability and SEO).

<header>: Header section of the page.
it’s common and semantically correct to place <nav> inside <header> because the navigation is typically
 part of the site's introductory or branding section.
<footer>: Footer section of the page.

<main>: Primary content.
<main> — What It Is:
Represents the main content of the page.
There should be only one <main> per page.
Excludes headers, footers, nav, sidebars.
<main>
  <section>
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We are a tech company...</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Services</h2>
    <p>Web design, SEO, marketing...</p>
  </section>
</main>

<article>: Self-contained content (like blog posts).
Content that makes sense on its own, even outside the page.

<section>: Section of related content.
Used to group related content into a logical section.
Think of it as a chapter or part of a document.

<nav>: Navigation links.
<aside>: Sidebar or supplementary content.
<figure>: Images, charts, or diagrams.
<mark>: Highlighted text.
<time>: Date/time representation.


<details>: Collapsible content section.
<summary>: Summary heading for <details>.
<details>
  <summary>Click to see more details</summary>
  <p>This is some hidden content that can be revealed by clicking the summary above.</p>
  <p>Additional details appear when the section is expanded.</p>
</details>
The <details> element is visible (because it contains the <summary>).
The <summary> is always shown — it's the clickable part.
The <p> (or any content inside <details>, except <summary>) is hidden by default.
When the user clicks the <summary>, the hidden content becomes visible.


1. Improved Accessibility
Screen readers rely on semantic tags (like <nav>, <header>, <main>, <article>, etc.) to understand your page structure.

Without them, visually impaired users might hear just "div, div, div..." — which is useless for navigation.

2. Better SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
Search engines like Google use semantic HTML to understand your page content better.

Using <article> tells search engines “this is a block of content,” <nav> means “this is navigation,” etc., which helps improve indexing and ranking.

3. Code Readability & Maintainability
When other developers (or future you!) look at your code, it's easier to understand:
