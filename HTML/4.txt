<link rel="stylesheet" href="./index.css">
Q.What is <link>
The <link> tag is used to link external resources to your HTML document.

Q.What are external resources
External resources mean:
Files that are outside your HTML file but are used by it — like:
CSS files for styling (.css)
Fonts, icons, or other assets

Q.why we can not include javascript using link tagIn HTML?
we use the <link> tag to include external resources like stylesheets, but not JavaScript,
because the <link> tag is designed for resources that are non-blocking 
and do not execute code, whereas JavaScript needs to be executed in the page's context.

What does rel="stylesheet" mean?
The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the HTML document and the linked resource
(in this case, the index.css file).
✅ rel="stylesheet"
This tells the browser:
“The file you're linking to is a CSS stylesheet.”
