Why Developers Use <ul> and <li> for Navbars:

A navigation menu is a list of links — so using <ul> communicates the intent clearly to browsers, screen readers, and other tools.

2. Accessibility (♿ Better Support for Screen Readers)
Assistive technologies (like screen readers) understand <ul>/<li> structures and announce them as lists, which helps users understand the structure of the page.

3. SEO Benefits (🔍 Better for Search Engines)
Clear, semantic HTML can help search engines interpret the structure of your site more effectively.

<nav> + <ul> + <li> gives more meaningful context than a series of random <div> elements.


Why <h1> is Recommended for SEO:
The <h1> tag typically represents the main heading or topic of a page.
Search engines like Google use it as a signal to understand what the page is about.
It helps with content hierarchy and improves crawlability and user experience.
