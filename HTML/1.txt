Q. What is <!DOCTYPE html>?
<!DOCTYPE html> is a Document Type Declaration (DOCTYPE) that tells the browser 
that the document is an HTML5 document. It must be the first line in an HTML file.

DOCTYPE
It stands for Document Type Declaration.

It tells the browser:
👉 “Hey! This is an HTML document — render it in standards mode (not quirks mode).”

✅ html
This part says:
👉 “The type of document is HTML5 (the latest HTML version).”

Why do we need to tell the browser to use standards mode?
Because browsers have to support billions of old web pages that were created before modern HTML standards 
existed — and many of those old pages contain non-standard or broken code. otherwise it will render in 
quirk mode.

 What is meant by “quirks” in this context?
"Quirks" refer to the non-standard, inconsistent, or buggy behaviors of early web browsers.

Quirks Mode is when a browser runs your website using old rules to support outdated websites.


Q.Is <!DOCTYPE> an HTML tag?
<!DOCTYPE> is not an HTML tag — it's a declaration that tells the browser what type of HTML to expect and 
how to render it (standards mode vs quirks mode).

Q.Is <!DOCTYPE> case-sensitive?
No


/* HTML TAG */
- A tag is just the markup keyword used to define HTML content.
- Always wrapped in angle brackets < >.
- Can be an opening tag (<p>), closing tag (</p>), or self-closing tag (<img />).
- Tags alone don’t carry any content.

Example:
<p>       → Opening tag
</p>      → Closing tag
<img />   → Self-closing tag

/* HTML ELEMENT */
- An element is the complete structure including:
  → Opening tag + content (optional) + closing tag
- Represents actual HTML content on the page.
- Can include attributes and nested elements.

Example:
<p>Hello World</p>   → This is a full element
<img src="logo.png" alt="Logo" />   → Self-closing element
