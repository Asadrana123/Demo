 What is 307 Temporary Redirect?
🔑 Definition (easy words):
“This page is temporarily moved. Go to the new location — but keep using the same HTTP method.”

🔄 Why 307 Was Introduced?
The older 302 Found confused browsers 😵.

When server sent this:

HTTP/1.1 302 Found  
Location: /new-login
And user sent:


POST /login
Many browsers wrongly said:

“Hmm, it’s a redirect... let’s just make a GET request to /new-login.”

😡 That broke things like:

Forms

Login systems

Any POST/PUT request

✅ How 307 Fixes That
With 307 Temporary Redirect, the browser/server says:

“Redirect to this new location — but do NOT change the method.”

So if the original request was:


POST /submit-form
and the response is:


HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect  
Location: /new-form
Then the browser correctly resends:


POST /new-form
✨ Including body, headers, everything — just like the original.

👨‍💻 Example in Real World:
Imagine you submit a payment:

POST /checkout
But the server temporarily wants to process payments on another backend:


/new-checkout
The server will send:


HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect  
Location: /new-checkout
Browser resends the same POST /new-checkout — safely.
