ðŸ¤” If HTTPS is better, then why does HTTP still exist?
âœ… 1. Backward Compatibility
Some old systems, devices, and websites still use HTTP.
Removing HTTP entirely would break them.

Example:
Old printers, CCTV setups, embedded IoT devices, etc.

âœ… 2. Intranet & Local Networks
On internal networks (LAN), developers use http://localhost or http://192.168.x.x â€” no need for encryption.

Because:

No sensitive data is sent

It's faster and easier for testing

âœ… 3. Certificate Hassle (in the past)
In the past, HTTPS required paid SSL certificates
Now it's free with Let's Encrypt, but some sites still use HTTP out of habit.

âœ… 4. Speed (used to be)
HTTP was faster because HTTPS had encryption overhead.
Now with HTTP/2 and TLS 1.3, HTTPS is super fast â€” but some people still think HTTP is faster.

âœ… 5. Misconfigured or Lazy Sites
Some websites just havenâ€™t upgraded yet.
Or they donâ€™t care about security because they think their site doesnâ€™t need it.

Example: Static websites that only show public data.

âœ… 6. Redirect Strategy
Most modern sites still support HTTP â€” but only to redirect to HTTPS.

Example:
http://example.com â†’ (302 redirect) â†’ https://example.com
So technically, HTTP exists just as a doorway to HTTPS.
