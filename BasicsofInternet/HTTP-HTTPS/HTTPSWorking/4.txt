🔑 1. AES – Advanced Encryption Standard
🔧 Type: An encryption algorithm
🔒 Purpose: Encrypts actual data (like your messages, files, etc.)

✅ Key Points:
Symmetric encryption: Same key is used to encrypt and decrypt.

Very fast and secure — great for encrypting big amounts of data.
Used after a secure connection is established (like in HTTPS).

Example: When you're chatting or sending images — AES encrypts the actual content.

🔐 2. TLS – Transport Layer Security
📦 Type: A security protocol
🛡️ Purpose: Creates a secure channel between two devices (like your browser and a website)

✅ Key Points:
TLS is a protocol, not an algorithm.

It uses algorithms like AES (for data), RSA (for key exchange), SHA (for integrity), etc.

Replaced SSL (which is old and insecure).

HTTPS = HTTP over TLS.

Latest version is TLS 1.3 (very fast and secure).

❌ 3. SSL – Secure Sockets Layer
🧓 Type: The older version of TLS
☠️ Status: Deprecated (no longer considered secure)

✅ Key Points:
SSL 2.0 and 3.0 were early attempts at secure connections.

TLS 1.0 was introduced as the upgrade to SSL 3.0.

Today, SSL is mostly a name people still use, but it's actually TLS under the hood.

If you see “SSL certificate,” it actually means “TLS certificate.”
