🔐 What is HTTPS?

✅ HTTPS stands for: HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure
✅ It is the secure version of HTTP.
✅ HTTPS uses SSL/TLS protocols to **encrypt** the data sent between browser and server.
⚠️ Why HTTPS is Needed?
Without HTTPS:

Anyone (like a hacker or Wi-Fi owner) can see or modify your data.

Login details, credit cards, or form inputs can be intercepted.

With HTTPS:

The data is encrypted (turned into gibberish).

Only the browser and server can understand it.

📄 What is SSL/TLS?
✅ SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are **encryption protocols**.
✅ TLS is the modern and more secure version (used today instead of SSL).
✅ They create a **secure channel** over an insecure network (like the internet).
🔄 SSL is outdated; when we say SSL, we actually use TLS behind the scenes.

🔐 What HTTPS Actually Does
✅ HTTPS = HTTP + TLS encryption
✅ It protects 3 things:
  1. 🕵️ Confidentiality – No one can read the data
  2. 🔐 Integrity – Data is not changed during transfer
  3. ✅ Authenticity – You're talking to the **real server**, not a fake one
🔄 How HTTPS Works (Step-by-Step)
🧪 Example: You visit https://example.com
✅ 1. Client Hello (Browser → Server)

🔹 Browser sends: "Hi! I want to talk securely."
🔹 It also sends supported encryption algorithms.
✅ 2. Server Hello + Certificate (Server → Browser)

🔹 Server replies: "Cool! Let’s use TLS 1.3 with AES encryption."
🔹 Also sends its digital certificate (includes public key).
✅ 3. Certificate Verification (Browser side)


🔍 Browser checks:
✔️ Is this certificate real?
✔️ Is it expired?
✔️ Was it issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)?
🌐 Certificate Authorities (CAs) are like digital notaries — they verify server identity.

✅ 4. Key Exchange (Secure Setup)

🔐 Browser uses server’s public key to create a "pre-master key."
🔐 Sends it securely to server.
💡 Now both browser & server calculate the same secret key, but no one in the middle can.

✅ 5. Encrypted Communication Starts

🔒 Now both browser and server use the shared secret key to:
➡️ Encrypt every request/response
➡️ Protect login data, forms, tokens, etc.
🧠 What is a Certificate?

✅ A digital certificate proves the identity of the server.
✅ Issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) like DigiCert, Let's Encrypt, etc.
✅ Contains:
  - Domain name
  - Public key
  - Validity period
  - Signature from CA
