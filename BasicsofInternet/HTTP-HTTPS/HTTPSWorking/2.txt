🔸 Chrome uses “HTTPS-First” strategy:
    - When you type a domain, Chrome tries HTTPS first
    - If it fails and fallback is allowed, it tries HTTP

🔸 Chrome maintains a “preload list” of HTTPS-only sites
    - Big sites are always forced to load in HTTPS

🔸 If a site only supports HTTP:
    - Chrome may show a warning
    - Or fallback silently, depending on settings

🔧 You can enable/disable this in browser settings under:
    Privacy & Security → Always use secure connections


🔒 Chrome’s “Always use secure connections” forces HTTPS-First mode.

✅ If site supports HTTPS → loads as normal

❌ If site does NOT support HTTPS:
   - Chrome shows a warning or blocks the site
   - You must manually allow it (not recommended)

⚙️ You can enable this in:
   Chrome Settings → Privacy & Security → Security → Always use secure connections
