What is 308 Permanent Redirect?
ðŸ”‘ Definition (in simple words):
"This resource has moved permanently to a new URL. Go there â€” and use the same HTTP method as the original request."

ðŸ¤¯ Why Was 308 Introduced?
In older days:

301 Moved Permanently redirected fine, but changed the method from POST to GET.

That was bad for forms, API calls, and payments.


ðŸ§  Example
Letâ€™s say your payment endpoint has permanently changed:

Original:


POST /pay-now
New:


https://secure.example.com/payments
Server response:


HTTP/1.1 308 Permanent Redirect
Location: https://secure.example.com/payments
Browser resends the exact same request using:


POST https://secure.example.com/payments
Keeps method: âœ…

Keeps body: âœ…

Redirects permanently: âœ…
