1. 400 Bad Request
🧠 Meaning:
“The request you sent is broken. I can’t even read it.”

🧪 Example:
You send invalid JSON:

{ name: "John"  // ← missing closing bracket
Or your query string is malformed:


/search?q=&&
Or content type is missing or incorrect:

Content-Type: text/plain  ← instead of application/json
🧠 When it happens?
Form data is corrupted

JSON body is bad

Headers are malformed

✅ Fix: Double-check your payload, headers, query params.

🔒 2. 401 Unauthorized
🧠 Meaning:
“You’re not logged in. I need credentials first.”

🧪 Example:
You try to access:


GET /dashboard
But don’t include a token or session cookie.

Response:

401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
✅ Fix:

Login first

Or include your token in headers:

Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
🚫 3. 403 Forbidden
🧠 Meaning:
“I know who you are, but you’re not allowed to do this.”

🧪 Example:
You're logged in, but you try to:

Access an admin page without being an admin

Delete someone else’s account

Upload to a restricted folder

✅ Fix:

Ask admin to grant permission

Update user roles/authorization rules

❓ 4. 404 Not Found
🧠 Meaning:
“This URL doesn’t exist on the server.”

🧪 Example:
You visit:


GET /profile/asad1234
But there's no user asad1234.

Or frontend calls:

GET /api/blogs/9999
But there is no blog with ID 9999.

✅ Fix:

Check if route or resource exists

Add 404 page in frontend

💣 5. 405 Method Not Allowed
🧠 Meaning:
“This endpoint exists — but you used the wrong HTTP method.”

🧪 Example:
js
// Server only supports GET
app.get("/books", ...)
You send:


POST /books
Response:


405 Method Not Allowed
Allow: GET
✅ Fix:

Use the correct method (GET, POST, etc.)

Read the API docs or error message

💡 6. 429 Too Many Requests
🧠 Meaning:
“Whoa! You’re sending too many requests. Slow down.”

🧪 Example:
You hit the login API 20 times in 10 seconds

Or your app sends 500 requests per minute

Response:


429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 60
✅ Fix:

Add rate limiting on frontend

Respect Retry-After header

Use exponential backoff in API calls
