 Request Headers (Sent by browser/client)
These are sent when you request something from the server.

Let’s go one by one:

1️⃣ Host
🧠 Says: "I’m trying to reach this website."

📦 Example:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Host: www.google.com
🔍 Why? Because a server can host multiple websites. This tells the server which one you want.

2️⃣ User-Agent
🧠 Says: "I’m Chrome on Windows" or "I’m Safari on iPhone."

📦 Example:

css
Copy
Edit
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
🔍 Why? Helps the server deliver platform-specific content (e.g., mobile vs desktop layout).

3️⃣ Accept
🧠 Says: "I want these content types (formats)."

📦 Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
Accept: text/html, application/json
🔍 Why? So the server knows whether to send HTML, JSON, XML, etc.

4️⃣ Accept-Language
🧠 Says: "I prefer this language."

📦 Example:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,hi;q=0.8
🔍 Why? Lets websites serve content in your language (English, Hindi, etc.).

5️⃣ Accept-Encoding
🧠 Says: "You can compress the response to save size."

📦 Example:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
🔍 Why? Enables compression like gzip to reduce response size = faster load time.

6️⃣ Content-Type (used with POST/PUT)
🧠 Says: "Here’s the format of the data I’m sending."

📦 Example:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Content-Type: application/json
🔍 Why? Server needs to know how to read the body — JSON, form data, etc.

7️⃣ Authorization
🧠 Says: "Here’s my login token or credentials."

📦 Example:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1...
🔍 Why? For protected APIs, the server needs this to check if you're allowed.

8️⃣ Cookie
🧠 Says: "Here are my cookies (session, user info)."

📦 Example:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Cookie: session_id=12345; theme=dark
🔍 Why? For keeping you logged in, saving preferences, etc.

9️⃣ Referer (Yes, it's misspelled in HTTP spec 😄)
🧠 Says: "I came here from this page."

📦 Example:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Referer: https://example.com/home
🔍 Why? Analytics, security, tracking where requests come from.

🔟 Origin
🧠 Says: "This is the domain that made the request."

📦 Example:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Origin: https://myfrontend.com
🔍 Why? Important for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) — lets server allow or block it.
