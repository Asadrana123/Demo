What is “Origin” in Web?
In web development, an origin is defined by 3 things:

Origin = Scheme + Host + Port

Component	     Example
Scheme	         http or https
Host (domain)	 example.com
Port	         80, 443, 5173, etc.

What is Cross-Origin?
A cross-origin request happens when your frontend (browser) tries to access 
a resource from a server that has a different origin.

That means any one of these 3 things is different:

Scheme
Domain
Port
