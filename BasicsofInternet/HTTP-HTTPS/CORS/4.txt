CORS is like a “rulebook” the browser and server follow to decide 
if a cross-origin request should be allowed or blocked.

Here are the main rules that CORS includes (in easy language):

1. Rule: Only the server can decide who is allowed.
   ➤ Server sends header: Access-Control-Allow-Origin
   ➤ Example: Allow all (*) or only specific domains

2. Rule: For unsafe HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE, etc.), browser must ask first.
   ➤ This is called a "Preflight Request"
   ➤ Browser sends an OPTIONS request first to check permission

3. Rule: Server must respond to OPTIONS with permission headers.
   ➤ Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, PUT, DELETE
   ➤ Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, etc.

4. Rule: If credentials (cookies, tokens) are used, both sides must agree.
   ➤ Client must set: credentials: "include"
   ➤ Server must set:
      - Access-Control-Allow-Origin: not "*", but specific domain
      - Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

5. Rule: If any rule fails, browser will block the request.
   ➤ Even if server responds — if headers are wrong, browser stops it.
