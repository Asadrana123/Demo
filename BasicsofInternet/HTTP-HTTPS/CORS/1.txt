🛡️ What is CORS?
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

📌 CORS is:
✅ A security mechanism (or browser policy)
❌ Not a protocol
❌ Not an algorithm
❌ Not part of HTTP methods
✅ It’s a set of rules built into browsers

Why was CORS created?
To protect users and stop websites from making unwanted requests to other websites 
on your behalf (cross-origin).

What is a “Cross-Origin” Request?
A request is cross-origin if the origin (domain, protocol, or port) of the frontend is different 
from the backend.

Example:
Frontend is hosted at https://myapp.com
Backend is hosted at https://api.mybackend.com
This is a cross-origin request → CORS is triggered.

✅ To **protect users** from malicious websites trying to access sensitive data 
from other sites.
❌ Without CORS, any random site could steal data using JavaScript by calling 
APIs on other domains.


✅ How to Fix It?
// Node.js + Express example
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"); // allow all origins
  next();
});


res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "https://my-frontend.com");
