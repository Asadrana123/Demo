🧠 What is a Preflight Request (in CORS)?
A preflight request is a "permission check" sent by your browser before the real request,
just to ask the server:

👉 “Hey, is it okay if I make this kind of request?”

It’s like knocking on someone’s door before entering their house.

🛫 Real-Life Analogy:
You want to enter someone’s home (the API server).
But first, you ask:

“Hey, can I come in and do X, Y, Z?”

If they say yes, you enter (real request is sent).

If they say no, the browser cancels the request before it even hits the server logic.

🔁 When does the browser send a preflight request?
✅ Only when the real request is "complex"
The browser auto-sends a preflight OPTIONS request before your real one if:

Condition	Example
1. Method is not GET, POST, or HEAD	e.g. PUT, DELETE, PATCH
2. You send custom headers	e.g. Authorization, X-Token, etc.
3. Content-Type is not application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, or text/plain
