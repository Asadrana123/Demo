✅ 3. Tracking & Analytics (Used by Ad Tech / SEO / Analytics Tools)
🕵️‍♂️ Use Case: “Track user behavior across pages or sites”
Cookies are used to track:

How many times a user visited

What pages they viewed

What ads they clicked

What they added to the cart

For example:

Set-Cookie: userTracker=xyz987; Max-Age=31536000
Tools like Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc. use this.
📌 Note: This is the part that leads to privacy laws (GDPR, cookie banners).



✅ 5. E-commerce: Shopping Cart
Even before logging in, a site can store your cart items using cookies:

Set-Cookie: cart=prod1,prod2,prod3
So if you leave and come back 2 hours later, your cart is still there!
🧠 In practice: most serious e-com sites use localStorage or backend sessions — 
but cookies are still an option.
Even without logging in, a server can send a guest session cookie to uniquely identify a user.
This cookie lets the server remember actions like adding to cart, so if the user returns later,
their cart is still available. It’s a stateless, anonymous way to provide continuity.
