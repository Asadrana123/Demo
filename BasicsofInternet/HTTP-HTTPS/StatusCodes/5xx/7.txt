What is a Load Balancer?
A Load Balancer is like a traffic manager that distributes 
incoming requests across multiple servers, so no single server gets 
overloaded and everything runs smoothly.

It helps with:

⚖️ Balanced performance

🚀 Faster response times

💥 Zero downtime (if one server crashes)

🔄 Real-world Analogy:
Imagine a restaurant with 4 cashiers 🍔

Customers (requests) enter the restaurant (your app).

If everyone lines up at 1 counter, it becomes slow 🐌.

So, the manager (load balancer) sends customers to the least busy counter.

That’s exactly what a load balancer does — distributes traffic to multiple servers.

✅ Where it's used in a web app?
Here’s a basic flow:

txt
Copy
Edit
         User (Browser)
              ↓
        [ Load Balancer ]
          ↙      ↓      ↘
   Server 1   Server 2   Server 3
Your React app (frontend) calls your backend API → 
the load balancer decides which server should handle it.
