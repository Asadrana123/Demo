What is a Gateway?
A Gateway is a network device or software component that connects two 
different systems, networks, or protocols, and translates data between them.
 It acts as a middleman to ensure communication is possible between things 
 that normally couldn’t talk directly.

✅ Real-Life Examples of Gateways
1. 🌐 Default Gateway (Home/Office Internet)
Your Wi-Fi router is your default gateway.

It connects your local network (like your laptop) to the internet.

It translates traffic from your private IP (e.g., 192.168.x.x) to a public IP and vice versa.

Example:


Laptop (192.168.0.101) → Router (192.168.0.1) → Internet
2. 🔁 API Gateway
Used in microservices architecture.

Acts as a single entry point for multiple backend services.

Adds features like routing, authentication, rate limiting, etc.

Example:

sql

Frontend → API Gateway → Auth Service / User Service / Product Service
Tools: NGINX, AWS API Gateway, Kong, Apigee

3. 🏦 Payment Gateway
Connects your app to banking/payment systems.

Securely processes payments and handles validation.

Example:

Your React App → Stripe Gateway → Bank/UPI/Card Networks
