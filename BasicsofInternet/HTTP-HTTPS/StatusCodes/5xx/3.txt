âœ… 3. To Improve Speed (Caching)
Some proxies save data (like images or scripts). If 1000 users request the same file:

First one hits the real server

The next 999 users get it from the proxy â€” way faster

âœ… 4. To Filter or Monitor Traffic
In schools/offices:

They use a proxy to block porn, social media, etc.

Or to monitor what employees browse

ðŸŽ¯ Real Example You Can Relate To:
You open React app and run:

npm run dev
Now you call:


fetch('/api/user')
Your React app doesn't actually talk to the backend.
Instead:

React dev server sees that /api is in your proxy config

It acts as a proxy and silently forwards the request to localhost:5000/api/user

So:


Browser â†’ React dev server (proxy) â†’ Backend server
No CORS error, no headache.
