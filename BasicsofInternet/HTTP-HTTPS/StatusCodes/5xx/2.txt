💥 What the f*** is a Proxy?
A proxy is a middleman between your browser and the server you're trying to reach.

🔧 In Simple Words:
When you send a request:

Without proxy:
YOU (Browser) 🧑‍💻 ───────▶ SERVER 🌐
With proxy:
YOU (Browser) 🧑‍💻 ─────▶ PROXY 🧱 ─────▶ SERVER 🌐
                                 ▲
                                 └─── Response goes back the same way
The proxy receives your request, forwards it to the server, gets the response, and passes it back to you.

🧠 But Why the Hell Do We Need This Middleman?
Great question. Here's why proxies are even used:

✅ 1. To Bypass CORS in Development
When you're building a React app:

Frontend runs on localhost:5173

Backend runs on localhost:5000

Browser says: ❌ "Nope, can't access that other port. CORS error."

So you tell Vite:


server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': 'http://localhost:5000'
  }
}
Now Vite becomes your proxy, so browser never sees the cross-origin request.

✅ Problem solved.

✅ 2. To Hide Your Identity
Proxies can hide your real IP address and location.

You → Proxy → Server

Server thinks the request is coming from the proxy, not you.
