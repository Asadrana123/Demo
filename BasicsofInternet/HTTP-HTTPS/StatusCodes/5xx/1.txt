 1. 500 Internal Server Error
🧠 Meaning:
“The server crashed while trying to handle your request.”

🔧 Example:
A bug in backend code throws an unhandled error:
let result = someUndefinedFunction(); // Crash 💥
Database went down suddenly

Null pointer, division by zero, syntax error in controller

⚠️ Server’s fault — not yours as the client
✅ Fix (server side):

Check logs
Add better error handling
Use try–catch, error middleware
