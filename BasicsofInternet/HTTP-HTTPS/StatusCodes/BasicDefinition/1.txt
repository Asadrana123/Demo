What Are HTTP Status Codes?
When you make a request (GET, POST, etc.), the server replies with a status code â€”
a 3-digit number that tells the result of your request.

 Status Code Categories
All status codes fall into 5 categories based on their first digit:

Range	  Category	      Meaning
1xx	      Informational	  "Got your request, keep going"
2xx	      Success	      "All good!"
3xx	      Redirection	  "Go somewhere else"
4xx	      Client Error	  "You made a mistake"
5xx	      Server Error	  "Server messed up"
