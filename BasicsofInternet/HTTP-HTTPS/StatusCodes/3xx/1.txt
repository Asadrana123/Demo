🟡 3xx – Redirection
🔁 301 – Moved Permanently
🧠 Meaning:
The page has permanently moved to a new URL. You should update your bookmarks or links.

📦 Use case:

Moving from http://example.com to https://example.com

Changing /about-us to /about

🔍 Important for SEO:
Search engines (like Google) will pass SEO power (ranking) to the new URL.

🔗 Example:

Old URL: http://example.com/about-us
New URL: http://example.com/about

If someone visits /about-us, the server responds with:
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: /about
And the browser will go to /about.

for front end we have to add this in our vercel.json for example:-
✅ If you're using Vercel:
1. Create a `vercel.json` file in your project root.
2. Define redirects using:
   {
     "source": "/old-path",
     "destination": "/new-path",
     "permanent": true
   }
3. Vercel will return real HTTP 301 for those paths.
4. This is great for SEO and user experience.
