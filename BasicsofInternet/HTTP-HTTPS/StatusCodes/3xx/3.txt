1. Who is changing the method from POST to GET?
➡️ The browser (client) is doing this.

Not the server. Not HTTP itself. The browser sees 302 Found and says:

“Oh, I should redirect! But I don’t know if I should keep using POST, so I’ll be safe and 
switch to GET.”

⚠️ This behavior is based on how browsers were historically implemented. And technically
 allowed by the HTTP spec for 302.



 What is a “Spec”?
A spec (short for specification) is the official rulebook that defines how 
a protocol or technology should work.

HTTP Spec = 📜 Official document that defines how HTTP works

What does a 302 mean?
Should the client keep the method?
What headers are allowed?
How should caching work?
What does Content-Type mean?


Without a spec:

Chrome, Firefox, Postman, Node.js, Apache, Nginx — all would behave differently 😵‍💫
