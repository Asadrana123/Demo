What Are HTTP Methods?
HTTP methods are verbs that tell the server what kind of action the
client (like your browser or frontend app) wants to perform on a resource (like a file, user, or product).

Think of them like CRUD operations:

Create → POST

Read → GET

Update → PUT / PATCH

Delete → DELETE

🔍 The Main HTTP Methods (with Real-World Examples)
1. 🔹 GET – Fetch Data

📦 It requests data from the server.

🚫 Doesn’t change anything (read-only).

📂 Data is sent in URL, not in body.


GET /users/42 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Used for: loading pages, fetching user data, loading images, etc.

🧪 Safe? ✅ Yes
🧪 Idempotent? ✅ Yes (same request, same result)

2. 🔸 POST – Create Something New
🛠 Sends data to the server to create a resource.

🧾 Data is sent in the request body, not in URL.

POST /users HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Asad",
  "role": "developer"
}
Used for: form submissions, login, signups, uploading files

🧪 Safe? ❌ No
🧪 Idempotent? ❌ No (2 calls = 2 records)
