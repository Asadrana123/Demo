✅ 3. Echo Origin (Dynamic Origin)
In server-side code:


res.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", req.headers.origin);
✅ Meaning:
Allow whatever origin sent the request — but only if it's in your whitelist.

🔐 Must Use with Care:
Check req.headers.origin against a list like:


const allowedOrigins = ['https://frontend.com', 'https://admin.frontend.com']
✅ Good for:
SaaS apps with multiple frontend dashboards

Admin vs user panels with different domains

✅ 4. null (Special Case)
http
Copy
Edit
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: null
✅ Meaning:
Only allow requests with Origin null

🤯 Wait, what’s null origin?
Origin: null can happen when:

Request comes from a file:// URL (local HTML file)

Sandboxed iframe (with no permissions)

Some older or embedded devices

⚠️ Rare Use Case:
You want to allow only requests from local files (dev tools or IoT dashboards)

🛑 ❌ Invalid Examples (Just to Be Clear)
Example	❌ Why it's Wrong
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://site1.com, https://site2.com	Not allowed! This header must be set only once with one value.
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: localhost	Not valid without scheme (http://localhost)
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: /.*/	Regex not supported in header directly
