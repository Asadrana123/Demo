Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
🔍 Why? Enables compression like gzip to reduce response size = faster load time.
6️⃣ Content-Type (used with POST/PUT)
🧠 Says: "Here’s the format of the data I’m sending."
📦 Example:


Content-Type: application/json
🔍 Why? Server needs to know how to read the body — JSON, form data, etc.

7️⃣ Authorization
🧠 Says: "Here’s my login token or credentials."

📦 Example:


Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1...
🔍 Why? For protected APIs, the server needs this to check if you're allowed.

8️⃣ Cookie
🧠 Says: "Here are my cookies (session, user info)."

📦 Example:


Cookie: session_id=12345; theme=dark
🔍 Why? For keeping you logged in, saving preferences, etc.

9️⃣ Referer (Yes, it's misspelled in HTTP spec 😄)
🧠 Says: "I came here from this page."

📦 Example:


Referer: https://example.com/home
🔍 Why? Analytics, security, tracking where requests come from.

🔟 Origin
🧠 Says: "This is the domain that made the request."

📦 Example:


Origin: https://myfrontend.com
🔍 Why? Important for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) — lets server allow or block it.
