1. Content-Type
🧠 Meaning:
Tells the browser what kind of content is being returned — like JSON, HTML, image, CSS, etc.

✅ Common values:

Content-Type: text/html
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Type: text/css
Content-Type: image/png

💡 Why it matters:
Your browser renders or handles data differently based on this.
If it says application/json, browser won’t try to render it as a page — it knows it's for 
JavaScript to parse.


🔹 2. Content-Length
🧠 Meaning:
The size (in bytes) of the response body.

💡 Why it matters:
Helps browsers know when the response is fully received.
Some browsers or proxies may refuse to load incomplete content.


3. Set-Cookie
🧠 Meaning:
Sends a cookie to the client. Your browser will store this and send it back with each request.

Example:

Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure; Max-Age=86400
🔐 Flags:

HttpOnly: JavaScript cannot access this cookie (prevents XSS).
Secure: Cookie is only sent over HTTPS.
Max-Age: How long cookie should live (in seconds).
SameSite: Controls cross-site request behavior.

What is SameSite?
SameSite is a security flag on a cookie that tells the browser:
"Should this cookie be sent with cross-site requests or not?"
It helps protect against attacks like CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).


🔹 4. Cache-Control
🧠 Meaning:
Gives caching instructions to browsers and CDNs.
Cache-Control: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-store
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
Cache-Control: public
Cache-Control: private


max-age=3600: Browser can cache for 1 hour.
no-store: Don't save anything (e.g., for banking).
public: Can be cached by CDNs or proxies.
private: Only client browser should cache.
