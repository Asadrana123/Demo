Request Headers (Sent by browser/client)
These are sent when you request something from the server.

Let’s go one by one:

1️⃣ Host
🧠 Says: "I’m trying to reach this website."

📦 Example:


Host: www.google.com
🔍 Why? Because a server can host multiple websites. This tells the server which one you want.

2️⃣ User-Agent
🧠 Says: "I’m Chrome on Windows" or "I’m Safari on iPhone."

📦 Example:


User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
🔍 Why? Helps the server deliver platform-specific content (e.g., mobile vs desktop layout).

3️⃣ Accept
🧠 Says: "I want these content types (formats)."

📦 Example:


Accept: text/html, application/json
🔍 Why? So the server knows whether to send HTML, JSON, XML, etc.

4️⃣ Accept-Language
🧠 Says: "I prefer this language."

📦 Example:


Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,hi;q=0.8
🔍 Why? Lets websites serve content in your language (English, Hindi, etc.).
5️⃣ Accept-Encoding
🧠 Says: "You can compress the response to save size."
📦 Example:
