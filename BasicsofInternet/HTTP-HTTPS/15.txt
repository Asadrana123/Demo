What is a Cookie?
A cookie is a small piece of data (text) that a server sends to your browser, 
and your browser stores it and sends it back with every request to the same server.

Feature	        Description
📦 Size limit	Small — max 4KB per cookie.
🌐 Scope	    Tied to domain + path — not shared across sites.
🔁 Auto-sent	Automatically sent with every HTTP request to the same domain.
🔐 Flags	    Can be secured with flags like HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite.

✅ 1. Authentication & Sessions (MOST COMMON)
🔑 Use Case: “Remember me — I’m logged in!”
When you log into a website (like Gmail, Amazon, etc.), the server 
sends a session cookie like:


Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure
The browser stores this, and automatically sends it with every request:


Cookie: sessionId=abc123
🔥 Why it matters:
This tells the server: “This is the same logged-in user as before.”
You stay logged in even when you refresh the page or visit a new one.
Without cookies, you'd have to log in on every page — super annoying.


✅ 2. Personalization / Preferences
🎨 Use Case: “Remember my dark mode, language, or currency”
Websites use cookies to remember your preferences:

Set-Cookie: theme=dark
Set-Cookie: language=hi
Next time you visit, the server or JavaScript reads these cookies and personalizes your experience without asking again.

Examples:
Instagram opens in dark mode if you chose it last time
Amazon shows prices in ₹ if you selected India
