What is IP?
IP stands for Internet Protocol.
It is like the addressing system of the Internet â€” it identifies 
every device (computer, phone, server) on the internet or local network.

What IP Actually Does:
Gives each device an address (like 192.168.1.1)
Breaks data into packets
Adds the source and destination IP to each packet
Forwards those packets across routers until they reach the destination
Helps reassemble them at the other end
