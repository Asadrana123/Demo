What is the Internet?
The Internet is a worldwide system of interconnected computer networks that use the TCP/IP protocol to communicate.
It connects billions of devices â€” computers, phones, servers, etc. â€” so they can send and receive data across the globe.

âœ… How the Internet Works â€” Step-by-Step
ðŸŸ¢ 1. Devices connect to a Local Network
Your phone or laptop connects to a router, either by Wi-Fi or Ethernet cable.

That router creates a Local Area Network (LAN).

ðŸŸ¢ 2. The Router connects to an ISP (Internet Service Provider)
The router connects to your ISP via a wired connection (like a fiber optic or DSL line).

ISP is your gateway to the Internet.

ðŸŸ¢ 3. ISP connects to the Internet Backbone
ISPs are connected to larger ISPs, and eventually to the Internet backbone â€” huge data lines across countries and oceans.

These backbones are owned by major telecom companies like Tata, AT&T, etc.

ðŸŸ¢ 4. Data travels using IP Routing
Every device on the internet has an IP address.

Data is broken into packets and routed using the IP address to its destination.

ðŸŸ¢ 5. Communication happens using Protocols
The most important ones are:

IP (Internet Protocol) â€“ Finds the destination.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) â€“ Ensures all packets arrive and in order.

HTTP/HTTPS â€“ Used to load websites.

ðŸŸ¢ 6. Servers handle your request
If you visit a website, your request is sent to the server hosting that site.

The server processes it and sends back HTML, CSS, JS, etc.

ðŸŸ¢ 7. Data travels back through the same route
Packets are returned to your device using the internet infrastructure.

Your browser assembles the packets and renders the webpage.

âœ… Key Concepts Simplified
Term	Meaning
Router	Device that connects your local network to the internet
ISP	Company that gives you access to the internet (like Jio, Airtel)
IP Address	Unique ID given to every device on the internet
Packet	Small chunk of data sent over the internet
Backbone	Massive, high-speed fiber-optic cables connecting countries & ISPs
TCP/IP	Protocols that ensure reliable data transfer
HTTP/HTTPS	Protocols for transferring website content

âœ… Real World Analogy
Devices (your laptop/phone) = Letter sender

IP address = House address

ISP = Post office

Packets = Envelopes

Routers = Roads and traffic lights

Server = Receiverâ€™s home

Protocols (TCP/IP) = Delivery rules

Internet = Global delivery network
