What is IP?
IP stands for Internet Protocol.
It is like the addressing system of the Internet — it identifies 
every device (computer, phone, server) on the internet or local network.

What IP Actually Does:
Gives each device an address (like 192.168.1.1)
Breaks data into packets
Adds the source and destination IP to each packet
Forwards those packets across routers until they reach the destination
Helps reassemble them at the other end

What is TCP
TCP is a communication protocol used to send data reliably between two computers over the internet.
It ensures that:

Data arrives in the correct order 📚

No data is lost, duplicated, or corrupted ❌💥

Sender and receiver agree before exchanging data 🤝

✅ Main Goal: Deliver every single piece of data accurately and in order.

🧠 Real-World Analogy
Imagine sending a book by courier:

You split the book into pages.

You number each page.

You wrap each page safely.

You get a delivery confirmation.

If a page gets lost, you resend it.

That’s how TCP works.

🏗️ How TCP Works — Step-by-Step
1️⃣ Connection Establishment (3-Way Handshake)
Before data is sent, TCP establishes a connection.

The 3 steps:

SYN: Client says “Hey, I want to talk!”

SYN-ACK: Server replies “Okay, I’m ready!”

ACK: Client responds “Great, let’s start!”

✅ Now both are connected securely and can start communication.

2️⃣ Data Transmission
Data is broken into packets 📦

Each packet has a sequence number (like page numbers)

TCP ensures order by using these numbers

If a packet is missing, it is resent

If a packet is corrupted, it is retransmitted

3️⃣ Acknowledgment (ACK)
Receiver sends an ACK (acknowledgment) after receiving each packet

If no ACK is received, sender resends the data

This makes it reliable

🧠 Think of it like:

“Got your message!” 👍
“Didn’t hear back? Let me resend.” 🔁

4️⃣ Flow Control
TCP checks:

If the receiver is overwhelmed

Then slows down sending

📦 Like asking:

“Can you handle more data right now?”

5️⃣ Congestion Control
If the network is busy, TCP reduces speed.
It avoids sending too much data that might get dropped.

🧠 Like slowing down on a traffic-jammed road 🚗🚗🚗

6️⃣ Connection Termination
When done:

One side says: “I’m done” (FIN)

Other says: “Okay, closing connection” (ACK)

✅ Ensures graceful disconnection

📦 TCP Packet Structure (Simplified)
Each packet contains:

Field	Purpose
Source Port	Where it came from
Destination Port	Where it's going
Sequence Number	Packet’s position/order
ACK Number	Last confirmed packet
Flags	For handshake/control
Checksum	Error checking
Data	Actual message

🌐 Where is TCP Used?
Use Case	Why TCP?
Websites (HTTP/HTTPS)	Pages must load completely & in order
File Downloads	You can’t miss even one byte
Emails	Entire message must arrive
Chat apps	You don’t want scrambled messages

⚙️ TCP Features Summary
Feature	Description
Reliable	Guaranteed delivery
Ordered	Packets received in sequence
Connection-based	Starts with 3-way handshake
Flow Control	Avoids overloading receiver
Congestion Control	Detects and avoids network traffic
Error Checking	Uses checksum for data integrity
