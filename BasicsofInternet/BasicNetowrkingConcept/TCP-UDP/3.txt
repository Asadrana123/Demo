What is UDP 
UDP is a communication protocol used to send data fast over the internet, without worrying about:
Order ❌
Delivery ❌
Errors ❌
✅ Main goal: Send data quickly, even if some gets lost.
How UDP Works (Step-by-Step)
🧱 1. No Connection Needed
Unlike TCP, UDP doesn’t do any handshake.
You just send the data — no setup, no confirmation.

🔹 That’s why UDP is called connectionless.

📦 2. Sends Data in Packets (Datagrams)
Data is split into small packets

Each packet is called a datagram

Packets travel independently

They may arrive out of order, late, or not at all

🔁 3. No Acknowledgment (ACK)
UDP never checks:

If the receiver got the data

If the packet was damaged or lost

If it arrived in the correct order

Once sent, it’s gone — UDP doesn’t care

📡 4. Very Fast
Since UDP skips:

Connection setup

Acknowledgment

Error checking
