✅ How Devices Get IPs (In Simple Terms)
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) runs on your router.

When your phone or laptop connects to Wi-Fi:

It asks for an IP.

Router gives a free one from its private range.

This IP is used inside your home.

✅ Real-Life Example
You visit google.com from your laptop:

Your laptop has a private IP (e.g., 192.168.1.5)

Router has a public IP (e.g., 49.204.90.22)

Router translates your request (NAT) and sends it to Google using the public IP.

Google responds, router sends it back to your laptop.

✅ NAT (Network Address Translation)
NAT is what allows multiple devices to use one public IP.

Example:

Your router has public IP 203.0.113.5

Your phone, laptop, and TV use private IPs

Router uses NAT to manage them all under one public IP

✅ Why IPv6 is the Future
Feature	IPv4	IPv6
Address Space	4.3 Billion	340 Undecillion
NAT Needed?	Yes	No
Security	Basic (optional)	Built-in (IPSec)
Addressing	Manual or DHCP	Auto-config (stateless)
Speed/Routing	Slower (more hops)	Faster (optimized)
