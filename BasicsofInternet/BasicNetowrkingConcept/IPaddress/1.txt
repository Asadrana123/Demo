What is an IP Address?
An IP Address (Internet Protocol Address) is a unique number assigned to every device connected to a network.
It acts like a home address on the Internet so data can find its way to the correct device.

âœ… Why Do We Need IP Addresses?
To identify every device uniquely.

To send and receive data on the Internet.

Without IP addresses, data wouldnâ€™t know where to go.
