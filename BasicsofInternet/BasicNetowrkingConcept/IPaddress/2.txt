🟢 IPv6 — Explained Simply
Uses 128 bits → 2¹²⁸ = MASSIVE number of addresses.

Format: 8 groups of 4 hex digits (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334)

Allows for almost unlimited IPs.

Built to fix the IPv4 exhaustion problem.

Also provides:

Better security

Faster routing

No need for NAT (explained later)
