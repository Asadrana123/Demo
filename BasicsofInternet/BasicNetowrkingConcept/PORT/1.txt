What is a Port (in Networking)?
A port is like a door or entry gate on a computer where data enters or leaves.

🔑 Think of your computer like a huge building 🏢
Each app or service (like browser, email, VS Code, etc.) lives on a different floor
The IP address gets the data to the building
The Port helps deliver it to the correct room or app

For your laptop:-
When data is sent to your computer:
It first reaches your IP address (your house)
Then it looks at the port number
Your operating system checks which program is listening on that port
It gives the data to the correct app

For server:-
✅ DNS lookup is the process of converting a domain name (like www.example.com) into an 
IP address — which tells us which server to contact.

✅ The port number (like :80 for HTTP or :443 for HTTPS) tells the server 
which service (or application) we want to communicate with — such as the web server.

✅ The domain name is also included in the Host header of the HTTP request. 
This tells the server which website we want to access — 
especially important if multiple websites are hosted on the same server (same IP).


🔹 By default, web servers use:
   - Port 80 for HTTP
   - Port 443 for HTTPS
🔹 These are the "standard ports" that browsers use automatically.
🔹 But developers can configure servers to listen on **custom ports** like 3000, 8080, 5000, etc.
🔹 If a server uses a custom port, users must specify it in the URL (e.g., http://example.com:8080).
