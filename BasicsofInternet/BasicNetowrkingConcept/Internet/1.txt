What is the Internet?
The Internet is a worldwide system of interconnected computer networks that use the TCP/IP protocol to communicate.
It connects billions of devices â€” computers, phones, servers, etc. â€” so they can send and receive data across the globe.

âœ… How the Internet Works â€” Step-by-Step
ðŸŸ¢ 1. Devices connect to a Local Network
Your phone or laptop connects to a router, either by Wi-Fi or Ethernet cable.

That router creates a Local Area Network (LAN).

ðŸŸ¢ 2. The Router connects to an ISP (Internet Service Provider)
The router connects to your ISP via a wired connection (like a fiber optic or DSL line).

ISP is your gateway to the Internet.

ðŸŸ¢ 3. ISP connects to the Internet Backbone
ISPs are connected to larger ISPs, and eventually to the Internet backbone â€” huge data lines across countries and oceans.

These backbones are owned by major telecom companies like Tata, AT&T, etc.
