Every device on the internet has an IP address.

Data is broken into packets and routed using the IP address to its destination.

The most important ones are:

IP (Internet Protocol) â€“ Finds the destination.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) â€“ Ensures all packets arrive and in order.

HTTP/HTTPS â€“ Used to load websites.

If you visit a website, your request is sent to the server hosting that site.

The server processes it and sends back HTML, CSS, JS, etc.
