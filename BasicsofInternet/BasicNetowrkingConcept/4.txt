MAC Address — Everything You Need to Know (for Front-End & CS Students)
✅ What is a MAC Address?
A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique ID assigned to every network interface (like your Wi-Fi or Ethernet port) by the manufacturer.
It helps devices identify each other on a local network (LAN).

✅ Format of MAC Address
Looks like this: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

6 groups of 2 hexadecimal digits (0–9, A–F)

Total: 48 bits (6 bytes)

✅ Example
Device	MAC Address
Laptop Wi-Fi	F4:5C:89:12:3B:7A
Mobile Hotspot	AC:DE:48:00:11:22

Each device’s network card (NIC) has a unique MAC address.

✅ Why Do We Need MAC Addresses?
Used to deliver data locally inside a network (LAN).

Helps switch/router identify which device is which.

IP address changes over time; MAC address stays constant (mostly).

✅ Where is MAC Address Used?
Layer	Protocol	Use of MAC
Data Link Layer	Ethernet / Wi-Fi	Device-to-device communication

Your router/switch uses MAC addresses to forward packets inside your home.

ARP protocol maps IP → MAC so data reaches correct device.

✅ MAC vs IP — The Difference
Feature	MAC Address	IP Address
Purpose	Unique ID for local device	Logical ID for global use
Who assigns it?	Hardware manufacturer	Network (DHCP/ISP)
Permanent?	Yes (can be changed manually)	No (can change anytime)
Format	F4:5C:89:12:3B:7A	192.168.0.1
Used in Layer	Layer 2 (Data Link)	Layer 3 (Network)
