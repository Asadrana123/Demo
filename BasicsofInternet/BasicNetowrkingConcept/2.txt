What is an IP Address?
An IP Address (Internet Protocol Address) is a unique number assigned to every device connected to a network.
It acts like a home address on the Internet so data can find its way to the correct device.

✅ Why Do We Need IP Addresses?
To identify every device uniquely.

To send and receive data on the Internet.

Without IP addresses, data wouldn’t know where to go.

✅ IP Address Format (2 Types)
Type	Format Example	Total Addresses	Introduced
IPv4	192.168.1.1	~4.3 Billion	1983
IPv6	2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334	~340 undecillion (massive)	1998

🟠 IPv4 — Explained Simply
Uses 32 bits → 2³² = ~4.3 billion addresses.

Format: A.B.C.D (e.g., 192.168.1.1)

Each part ranges from 0 to 255

Example: 192.0.2.1

✅ Still widely used today, but running out of unique addresses.

🟢 IPv6 — Explained Simply
Uses 128 bits → 2¹²⁸ = MASSIVE number of addresses.

Format: 8 groups of 4 hex digits (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334)

Allows for almost unlimited IPs.

Built to fix the IPv4 exhaustion problem.

Also provides:

Better security

Faster routing

No need for NAT (explained later)

✅ Types of IP Addresses
🔹 Public IP
Given by your ISP

Used to identify your network on the Internet

Example: 183.82.123.99

🔹 Private IP
Used inside your home or office

Given by router to connected devices

Example: 192.168.0.1, 10.0.0.5

🔒 Private IPs can't be accessed directly from the internet.

✅ Static vs Dynamic IP
Type	Meaning	Given by
Static	Does not change	ISP/manual
Dynamic	Changes over time (temporary)	DHCP Server

Most users get dynamic IPs automatically.

✅ Reserved Ranges for Private IP (IPv4)
Range	Used For
10.0.0.0/8	Large networks
172.16.0.0/12	Medium networks
192.168.0.0/16	Home/small networks

✅ How Devices Get IPs (In Simple Terms)
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) runs on your router.

When your phone or laptop connects to Wi-Fi:

It asks for an IP.

Router gives a free one from its private range.

This IP is used inside your home.

✅ Real-Life Example
You visit google.com from your laptop:

Your laptop has a private IP (e.g., 192.168.1.5)

Router has a public IP (e.g., 49.204.90.22)

Router translates your request (NAT) and sends it to Google using the public IP.

Google responds, router sends it back to your laptop.

✅ NAT (Network Address Translation)
NAT is what allows multiple devices to use one public IP.

Example:

Your router has public IP 203.0.113.5

Your phone, laptop, and TV use private IPs

Router uses NAT to manage them all under one public IP

✅ Why IPv6 is the Future
Feature	IPv4	IPv6
Address Space	4.3 Billion	340 Undecillion
NAT Needed?	Yes	No
Security	Basic (optional)	Built-in (IPSec)
Addressing	Manual or DHCP	Auto-config (stateless)
Speed/Routing	Slower (more hops)	Faster (optimized)
