💡 Why not redesign everything to use IP only?
That’s a fair idea — but:

Ethernet and MAC were designed decades ago, before IP even became dominant

Billions of devices already depend on this structure

IP operates at a higher layer (Layer 3), and Layer 2 has no concept of IP

Ethernet is like a postal truck: it only understands names and apartment numbers (MAC) — 
not street addresses (IP)

🔁 Could we theoretically replace MAC with IP?
In theory: yes — if we redesigned Ethernet and Wi-Fi from scratch.

In practice: no — because:

MACs are fast, hardware-level IDs

IPs can change (via DHCP), but MACs are stable

It separates physical delivery (MAC) from logical addressing/routing (IP), which gives flexibility

✅ Final Answer
We need MAC addresses because Ethernet and Wi-Fi don't understand IP.
Because Ethernet and Wi-Fi hardware (Layer 2) is physically designed to understand MAC addresses only, 
not IP addresses.

They're hardware-level protocols that deliver data using MAC.
address — that's why ARP exists: to bridge the gap.
