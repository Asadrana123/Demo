✅ What Happens in a Local Network?
Your device wants to talk to 192.168.0.1 (router)
It sends an ARP request: “Who has IP 192.168.0.1?”
Router replies with its MAC address
Device then sends the data using that MAC address
Switch forwards the data based on MAC – not IP

✅ Types of MAC Address
Type	Meaning
Unicast	Identifies a single device (normal case)
Multicast	Identifies a group of devices (like live stream)
Broadcast	Sent to all devices on the network

✅ Can We Change MAC Address?
Yes. It's called MAC spoofing:
For privacy
For testing networks
But usually not needed for most users



What happens under the hood
When you say:

"Send this packet to 192.168.0.5"

Your system says:

“Okay, to do that, I must first find the MAC address of 192.168.0.5”

Sends an ARP request to ask:
“Who has IP 192.168.0.5? Tell me your MAC.”

Once it gets the MAC, it puts the data inside a frame addressed to that MAC

Ethernet frame = like an envelope
MAC address = recipient's name
IP = logical address inside the letter
