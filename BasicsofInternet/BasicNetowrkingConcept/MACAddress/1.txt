MAC Address — Everything You Need to Know (for Front-End & CS Students)
✅ What is a MAC Address?
A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique ID assigned to every network interface 
(like your Wi-Fi or Ethernet port) by the manufacturer.
It helps devices identify each other on a local network (LAN).

✅ Format of MAC Address
Looks like this: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

6 groups of 2 hexadecimal digits (0–9, A–F)

Total: 48 bits (6 bytes)

✅ Example
Device	MAC Address
Laptop Wi-Fi	F4:5C:89:12:3B:7A
Mobile Hotspot	AC:DE:48:00:11:22

Each device’s network card (NIC) has a unique MAC address.
