✅ Why Do We Need MAC Addresses?
Used to deliver data locally inside a network (LAN).

Helps switch/router identify which device is which.

IP address changes over time; MAC address stays constant (mostly).

✅ Where is MAC Address Used?
Layer	Protocol	Use of MAC
Data Link Layer	Ethernet / Wi-Fi	Device-to-device communication

Your router/switch uses MAC addresses to forward packets inside your home.

ARP protocol maps IP → MAC so data reaches correct device.

✅ MAC vs IP — The Difference
Feature	MAC Address	IP Address
Purpose	Unique ID for local device	Logical ID for global use
Who assigns it?	Hardware manufacturer	Network (DHCP/ISP)
Permanent?	Yes (can be changed manually)	No (can change anytime)
Format	F4:5C:89:12:3B:7A	192.168.0.1
Used in Layer	Layer 2 (Data Link)	Layer 3 (Network)
