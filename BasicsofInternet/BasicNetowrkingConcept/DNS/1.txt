Domain Name System (DNS) — Explained for Front-End Developers & CS Students
✅ What is DNS?
DNS stands for Domain Name System.
It’s like the phonebook of the internet.
It translates human-readable domain names like www.google.com into IP addresses like 142.250.64.100.

✅ Why Do We Need DNS?
Computers communicate using IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1)

Humans remember names, not numbers

DNS bridges the gap by converting domain → IP

✅ Real-Life Analogy
Action	DNS Equivalent
You search "Pizza Hut" on Maps	Google Maps finds its location
You type facebook.com in browser	DNS finds its IP address

✅ Example (What Happens When You Type a URL)
You type www.facebook.com:

Browser asks OS: “Do you know the IP of facebook.com?”

OS checks local DNS cache

If not found → sends request to DNS resolver (ISP)

Resolver checks its own cache

If still not found → asks Root DNS server

Then goes to TLD server (.com, .net, etc.)

Then goes to Authoritative DNS (holds actual IP)

Finally, the IP is returned and browser makes request
