✅ DNS Caching
To improve speed, DNS responses are cached:

Where It's Cached	Purpose
Browser	Immediate access to past sites
Operating System	Faster local lookup
DNS Resolver (ISP)	Avoid asking root servers

⏱ TTL (Time To Live) = How long to cache DNS entry

✅ What Happens if DNS Fails?
Typing google.com won’t work because IP is unknown

You get a "DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN" error
