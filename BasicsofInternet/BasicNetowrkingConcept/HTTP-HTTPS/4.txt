How Does HTTPS Work? (Step-by-step)
You type: https://example.com

Browser says: “Hey server, show me your SSL certificate!”

Server replies: “Here’s my certificate (proof I’m real).”

Browser verifies it (using trusted certificate authority list)

Both browser and server agree on encryption keys

✅ Secure encrypted communication begins!

📜 What is an SSL/TLS Certificate?
It’s like a website’s ID card, issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) like:

Let’s Encrypt

DigiCert

GoDaddy

Cloudflare

It includes:

The domain name

The public key (for encryption)

Expiration date

CA’s digital signature
