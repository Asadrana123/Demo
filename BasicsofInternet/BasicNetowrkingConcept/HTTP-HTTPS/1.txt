HTTP Protocol:-
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is an application-layer protocol used for communication 
between two systems over a network. It defines how requests and responses are formatted and 
exchanged, typically to transfer data like webpages, files, or APIs. While it’s widely used 
for web browsing, it’s not limited to browsers or the internet —
 HTTP can be used in any environment where two systems need to exchange structured information,
as long as there's a TCP connection.
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol
It’s the language your browser and web servers use to talk to each other.

A universal set of rules (protocol) that both the sender (client) and receiver (server) follow 
to communicate smoothly and efficiently over the web.

Because HTTP doesn’t care what content it transfers —
it's just a transport protocol.



GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1245

<html> ... </html>


Why Is HTTP Called “Stateless”?
HTTP doesn’t remember anything.

Every request is independent.

If you visit a page 3 times, the server treats each as new, unless cookies or sessions are used.
