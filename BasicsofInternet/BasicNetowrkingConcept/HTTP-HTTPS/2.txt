ðŸ“œ HTTP Versions:
1. HTTP/0.9 (1991)
ðŸŒ± The very first version.

Only supported GET request.

No headers, no status codes, no metadata.

Response was just plain HTML â€” nothing else.

2. HTTP/1.0 (1996)
Introduced:

Status codes (like 200 OK, 404 Not Found)

Headers (like Content-Type, Content-Length)

Support for media types (images, etc.)

Connection closed after each request-response (not efficient).

3. HTTP/1.1 (1997 â€” still widely used)
Introduced:

Persistent connections (keep-alive)

Chunked transfer encoding

Caching mechanisms

Host header (allows virtual hosting â€” multiple websites on same IP)

Still text-based, but much more powerful than 1.0.

4. HTTP/2 (2015)
Major improvements:

Binary protocol (instead of text)

Multiplexing (multiple requests in parallel on a single connection)

Header compression (HPACK)

Faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1

Fully backward compatible with HTTP/1.1 APIs.

5. HTTP/3 (2022 â€” becoming more common)
Runs on QUIC instead of TCP.

Benefits:

Even faster than HTTP/2

Built-in encryption (always HTTPS)

Solves head-of-line blocking issue in HTTP/2

Becoming the standard for performance-heavy apps like YouTube, Facebook, etc.
