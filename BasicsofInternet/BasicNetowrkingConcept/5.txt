✅ What Happens in a Local Network?
Your device wants to talk to 192.168.0.1 (router)

It sends an ARP request: “Who has IP 192.168.0.1?”

Router replies with its MAC address

Device then sends the data using that MAC address

Switch forwards the data based on MAC – not IP

✅ Types of MAC Address
Type	Meaning
Unicast	Identifies a single device (normal case)
Multicast	Identifies a group of devices (like live stream)
Broadcast	Sent to all devices on the network

✅ Can We Change MAC Address?
Yes. It's called MAC spoofing:

For privacy

For testing networks

But usually not needed for most users



What happens under the hood
When you say:

"Send this packet to 192.168.0.5"

Your system says:

“Okay, to do that, I must first find the MAC address of 192.168.0.5”

Sends an ARP request to ask:
“Who has IP 192.168.0.5? Tell me your MAC.”

Once it gets the MAC, it puts the data inside a frame addressed to that MAC

Ethernet frame = like an envelope
MAC address = recipient's name
IP = logical address inside the letter

💡 Why not redesign everything to use IP only?
That’s a fair idea — but:

Ethernet and MAC were designed decades ago, before IP even became dominant

Billions of devices already depend on this structure

IP operates at a higher layer (Layer 3), and Layer 2 has no concept of IP

Ethernet is like a postal truck: it only understands names and apartment numbers (MAC) — 
not street addresses (IP)

🔁 Could we theoretically replace MAC with IP?
In theory: yes — if we redesigned Ethernet and Wi-Fi from scratch.

In practice: no — because:

MACs are fast, hardware-level IDs

IPs can change (via DHCP), but MACs are stable

It separates physical delivery (MAC) from logical addressing/routing (IP), which gives flexibility

✅ Final Answer
We need MAC addresses because Ethernet and Wi-Fi don't understand IP.
Because Ethernet and Wi-Fi hardware (Layer 2) is physically designed to understand MAC addresses only, 
not IP addresses.

They're hardware-level protocols that deliver data using MAC.
address — that's why ARP exists: to bridge the gap.
