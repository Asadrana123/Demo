What is HTTPS?
HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure
It’s the secure version of HTTP — all communication is encrypted between 
your browser and the server.

What Makes HTTPS Secure?
HTTPS =
HTTP + SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security)
These are cryptographic protocols that:
Encrypt your data (so no one else can read it)
Authenticate the server (so you know it’s really Google, not a fake)
Ensure data integrity (no one can change the data in transit)
