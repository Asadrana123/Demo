What is NAT?
NAT = Network Address Translation
It is a technique used by your router to allow multiple devices to share one public IP address.

 Now if all 3 devices want to use the internet:
They send requests to the router

Router uses NAT to:
Replace their private IPs with its public IP
Keep a record of who asked what
When the responses come back:
The router checks its NAT table
Sends the reply to the correct private IP device


 Now: You open google.com from your laptop
Step 1: Laptop sends a request:
From: 192.168.0.2:54321

To: 142.250.195.132:80 (Google's server)

Step 2: Router receives this request and does NAT
It changes the source IP to public IP:
49.37.88.7:10001 (assigns a unique port)

Stores in NAT table:

Private IP:Port	Public IP:Port
192.168.0.2:54321	49.37.88.7:10001

✅ This tells the router:

“If a reply comes to 49.37.88.7:10001, send it to 192.168.0.2:54321 (Laptop)”

Step 3: Google server replies
Sends data to: 49.37.88.7:10001

Step 4: Router checks NAT table
It finds: 10001 → 192.168.0.2

So it sends the reply to your laptop
