âœ… What is fetch?
fetch() is a built-in JavaScript function used to make HTTP requests 
(like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) from the browser.

Think of fetch() like a way for your frontend code to talk to a backend server or API, 
just like how we use WhatsApp to send messages.

fetch(url, options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // use the data here
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // handle errors
  });
