3. 🌐 Statelessness
Every request must contain all the information needed to process it.

✅ The server should not "remember" previous requests.
Each request is treated as independent.

This means:

No server-side session storage

If you're logged in, your request should include the token every time (usually in headers)

📌 Why?
This makes your API scalable — any server can handle any request, no memory needed.

4. 💾 Client–Server Architecture
The frontend (client) and backend (server) should be separate.

Client: handles UI and user interaction

Server: handles data storage, business logic

📌 Why?
This separation allows each side to evolve independently. You can redesign your frontend without touching backend logic, and vice versa.
