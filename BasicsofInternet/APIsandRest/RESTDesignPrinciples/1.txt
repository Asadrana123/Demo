🧠 The 6 RESTful Principles (also called constraints)
Let’s break them down one by one, in plain English.

1. 🔗 Uniform Interface
✅ This is the core idea of REST.

It means:

“All your API endpoints should look and behave in a consistent way.”

This includes:

Use URLs to represent resources:
/users, /products/123, /orders/567/items

Use HTTP methods properly:

GET → read data

POST → create new data

PUT → replace data

PATCH → update part of the data

DELETE → remove data

Return proper status codes: 200, 201, 404, 400, etc.

Use JSON (or other formats) to represent data consistently.

📌 Why is this important?
Because if the API is predictable, it’s easy to learn and use.

2. 📦 Resources (Nouns, not Verbs)
In REST, we treat everything as a resource.

A resource is something you can create, read, update, or delete — like:

users

posts

comments

products

So your endpoints should look like:

✅ GET /users/1 — get user 1

✅ POST /users — create user

✅ DELETE /users/1 — delete user

❌ Not like: GET /getUser, POST /addUser — these are verb-based and not RESTful.
