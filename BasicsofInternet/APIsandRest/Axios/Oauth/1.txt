3️⃣ OAuth 2.0 — 🌍 Used in Big Platforms (Google, Facebook, GitHub)
🧠 What is it?
OAuth is an authorization framework that lets users log in using another service (like Google or GitHub).

You don't manage passwords — the third-party does.

🔁 Workflow:
(For front-end login with Google, GitHub, etc.)
User clicks “Login with Google”

Redirects to Google’s consent screen

User allows permissions (email, profile)

Google redirects back with a code

Frontend exchanges that code for an access token

Use token to make requests on behalf of user

✅ Pros:
Secure login using trusted identity providers

No password stored by you

Used by almost all social login systems

❌ Cons:
Complex to implement

Multiple steps + redirects

Needs secure backend handling



✅ Frontend Example (OAuth with Google)

  &redirect_uri=...
  &response_type=code
  &scope=email profile
