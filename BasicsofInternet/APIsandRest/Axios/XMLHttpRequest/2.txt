💡 What is AJAX?
🔤 Full Form:
AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML

✅ Simple Definition:
AJAX is a technique that allows a web page to talk to the server in the background, without 
reloading the entire page.

This means:

JavaScript can ask the server for new data,

And update part of the page (like a table, form, message, or dropdown),

Without refreshing or navigating away from the current page.

🔍 What is AJAX actually made of?
AJAX is not a single technology — it's a combination of 5 things working together:

Technology	        Role in AJAX
HTML	            Structure of the page
CSS	                Styling the page
JavaScript	        Adds logic and handles dynamic behavior
DOM API	Updates     parts of the page
XHR or Fetch API	Talks to the server in background
