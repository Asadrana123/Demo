ðŸ§¬ Key Concepts of GraphQL
1. âœ… Single Endpoint
REST: multiple endpoints (/users, /users/1/posts, /comments)

GraphQL: one endpoint (/graphql) and you describe what you want in the query.

2. âœ… Precise Data Fetching
Ask only for the fields you need.

No over-fetching or under-fetching.

3. âœ… Nested Requests in One Go
In REST, to get:

A user
Their posts
Comments on each post

You need 3 separate requests.

In GraphQL:

graphql
{
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    posts {
      title
      comments {
        text
      }
    }
  }
}
ðŸ“¦ All in one request!

4. âœ… Strongly Typed Schema
GraphQL APIs have a schema that defines what data exists and what queries you can make.

This schema is like:

A contract between frontend and backend.

Self-documented.
Type-safe.

5. âœ… Real-time Support with Subscriptions
GraphQL supports live updates using something called "subscriptions", which is harder in REST.
