🧠 What Actually Is an API in Web Development?
Let’s say it super simply:
✅ An API is like a menu of the backend server.
When the frontend wants to talk to the backend, it needs some defined ways to ask for data or send data. 
These ways are called APIs.

📦 An API is:
A set of rules (URLs + methods) defined by the backend server that the frontend can use to:

get data
send data
update data
delete data

Think of it as the "official entry points" into a server.


❌ Misunderstanding Cleared
❌ API is NOT just a URL.
❌ API is NOT the HTTP request.
✅ API is the "set of rules + endpoints" made available by the server.

The HTTP request is how you call or use the API.
