🧠 What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a query language for APIs — created by Facebook — 
that lets the client decide exactly what data it needs.

In short:
Instead of the server deciding what to send…
👉 the client (like your React app) tells the server:
"Hey, I want this, this, and this — nothing else."

🔍 Real-Life Example: REST vs GraphQL
Suppose you're building a user profile page that needs:

Name
Email
Profile Picture

🧱 REST (Typical Case)
You might call:


GET /user/123
And the server sends back:

json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Asad",
  "email": "asad@email.com",
  "profile_picture": "url",
  "created_at": "...",
  "updated_at": "...",
  "roles": [...],
  "status": "active",
  "more_unneeded_data": "..."
}
🔻 Problem: You're getting extra stuff you don’t need.

🔮 GraphQL (Same Case)
You send this query:

graphql
{
  user(id: 123) {
    name
    email
    profile_picture
  }
}
And the server replies with only what you asked:

json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Asad",
      "email": "asad@email.com",
      "profile_picture": "url"
    }
  }
}
🎯 You get exactly what you need — nothing more.
