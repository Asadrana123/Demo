OSI didn’t try to replace TCP/IP — it was created to solve a different problem:
Giving the world a clean, vendor-neutral, universal reference model to design, teach, 
and troubleshoot any kind of network — not just the internet.

Yes, TCP/IP works great, but OSI teaches you why it works and how to think in layers — 
that’s the real value.

TCP/IP  is optimized and primarily designed for internet-based communication.
