✅ 1️⃣ What is SSE?
SSE means Server-Sent Events.
It’s a built-in browser feature that lets your server send real-time updates 
to the browser over a normal HTTP connection — but only one-way.


✅ 7️⃣ Why not just use WebSockets always?
SSE is built into browsers, super simple, works with normal HTTP/2 proxies.
For one-way streaming (server → client), it’s lighter than WebSockets.
WebSockets are better if you need bi-directional messages or complex real-time flows.
