‚úÖ HOW does it work?
1Ô∏è‚É£ The client (browser) starts with a normal HTTP request with Upgrade: websocket header.

2Ô∏è‚É£ If the server supports it, it replies:


HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
3Ô∏è‚É£ Now the connection switches from HTTP to the WebSocket protocol over TCP.
This is called the WebSocket handshake.

4Ô∏è‚É£ From this point on:

The connection stays open.

Both sides (client & server) can send messages any time ‚Äî without waiting for the other side.

This is called full-duplex communication.
