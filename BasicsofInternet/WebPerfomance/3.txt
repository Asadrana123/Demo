âœ… What is bandwidth?
Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be transferred over a network connection per second.

Itâ€™s usually measured in bits per second (bps) â€” e.g., Mbps (megabits per second) or Gbps
 (gigabits per second).

ðŸ“¶ Simple analogy:
Think of bandwidth like the width of a water pipe â€” the wider the pipe, the more water (data)
 can flow through at the same time.
