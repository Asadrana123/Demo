Latency is the time it takes for a message to travel from the sender to the receiver.

🕒 It’s measured in milliseconds (ms).

🔁 In Web Terms:
Time between clicking a button → and seeing a server response

Time to connect to a server (TCP handshake, DNS lookup, SSL negotiation)

🧪 Example:
You click a button → request goes to:
