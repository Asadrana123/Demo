1️⃣ Physical distance
🗺️ How far is your user from your server?
Data travels over cables and through networks at about ⅔ the speed of light.

More distance → more time → higher latency.

Example:
If your server is in New York, but your user is in Singapore, the data has to travel halfway around the world.

2️⃣ Number of network hops
🪜 How many intermediate routers and switches are in the path?
Data doesn’t go directly — it goes through multiple routers, switches, and sometimes other networks.

Each “hop” adds a tiny delay (processing time).

More hops → more latency.

3️⃣ Quality of the network connection
🕸️ Network congestion, packet loss, and routing
Congested networks (lots of traffic) can cause delays.

Packet loss means some data has to be resent, adding time.

Bad routing: Sometimes data takes inefficient paths.

4️⃣ DNS resolution time
🌐 How long does it take to look up the server’s IP?
When you visit www.example.com, your browser must ask a DNS server: “What is the IP?”

DNS lookups can add 10–200ms of latency.

5️⃣ TCP connection setup
🤝 The “handshake”
Before data transfers, your browser and the server establish a TCP connection (3-way handshake).

Each handshake = 1 round trip.

More connections → more handshake overhead → more latency.

6️⃣ TLS/SSL negotiation
🔐 Secure connections
If your site uses HTTPS (which it should!), there’s a TLS handshake to establish encryption.

This adds extra round trips.

So HTTPS is slightly higher latency than plain HTTP (but needed for security).

7️⃣ Server processing time
🗂️ How fast does the server handle your request?
After the request arrives, the server needs to:

Parse it

Run logic

Query the database

Prepare a response

Slow backends or heavy database queries = higher latency.

8️⃣ Payload size
📦 How much data are you transferring?
Bigger files take longer to send.

Compression helps reduce this, but large images or videos can increase latency.

9️⃣ CDN and caching
🌍 Using edge servers
CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) serve data from edge servers closer to the user.

This reduces physical distance and latency.

No CDN → higher latency for global users.
