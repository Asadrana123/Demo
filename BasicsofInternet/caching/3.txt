✅ 3️⃣ Server-Side Caching
How it works
Your backend stores precomputed data in memory or a fast store like Redis.

Example: results of expensive DB queries, or rendered HTML for pages that rarely change.

Why?
Saves time → doesn’t have to regenerate same response over and over.

Great for pages or API results that don’t change every request.

Real example
E-commerce site caches product listings.

Instead of running the same SELECT * FROM products 10,000 times, you cache the result for 5 minutes.

✅ Good for dynamic but frequently-requested data.
