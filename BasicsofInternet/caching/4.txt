✅ 1️⃣ What is Cache-Control?
Cache-Control is an HTTP response header you set on your server.
It tells browsers (and CDNs, proxies) how to cache your resource.

📜 Common Cache-Control directives:

| Directive         | Meaning                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `max-age=86400`   | Cache for **86400 seconds** (24 hours)       |
| `public`          | Any cache (browser, CDN, proxy) can store it |
| `private`         | Only **end user’s browser** can store it     |
| `no-store`        | **Never store** in cache — always re-fetch   |
| `no-cache`        | Store, but always revalidate with server     |
| `must-revalidate` | If expired, must revalidate before using     |



✅ Example for a static file:

Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

public → can be cached by browser & CDN.

max-age=31536000 → cache for 1 year.

immutable → means “don’t revalidate, this file will never change.”
