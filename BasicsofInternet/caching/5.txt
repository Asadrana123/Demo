✅ 2️⃣ What are ETags?
An ETag (Entity Tag) is a unique ID (like a hash or version string) 
that the server attaches to a resource.

When the browser caches the resource, it saves the ETag too.


🔑 Why use it?
On next request, the browser says:

“Hey server, my copy has ETag abc123. Is that still the latest?”

If the file hasn’t changed:

Server responds 304 Not Modified → no new download!

Saves bandwidth.

If the file has changed:

Server sends a new file + new ETag.

⚡ Real-life example
1️⃣ You request main.js

2️⃣ Server responds:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ETag: "v1.2.3"


3️⃣ Next visit:
GET /main.js
If-None-Match: "v1.2.3"
Server:

If ETag matches → 304 Not Modified

If ETag doesn’t match → sends updated main.js
