✅ 2️⃣ CDN Caching
How it works
A CDN (Content Delivery Network) keeps copies of your files on edge servers worldwide.

When a user requests your file, it’s served from the nearest POP (Point of Presence).

This cuts down distance → lower latency.

Also reduces load on your origin server.

Real example
Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS CloudFront — all do this.

Your image.jpg is stored on a CDN edge server in Singapore → user in Jakarta gets it lightning fast, 
instead of from your origin in New York.

✅ Excellent for static content: images, videos, CSS, JS, fonts.
