🧨 What is CSRF?
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack where 
the attacker tricks a logged-in user into unknowingly performing an action on a 
trusted website — like transferring money or changing a password — without their consent.

Real-Life CSRF Example (Without Protection)
You’re logged in to:

https://yourbank.com
Your cookies:

Cookie: sessionId=abc123
Now, attacker tricks you to click a fake link:

<img src="https://yourbank.com/transfer?to=hacker&amount=1000" />
Since your browser automatically sends cookies with every request:

The bank sees the request as legitimate
The money is transferred ❌

🧠 Why CSRF Works
Browsers automatically attach cookies with every request to the domain

Server trusts the cookie

There’s no way to tell if the request came from your app or from an attacker
