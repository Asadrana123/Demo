🟢 Step 1: What is a CDN (Content Delivery Network)?
CDN is a network of servers around the world that store and deliver 
website content (images, videos, scripts, HTML, etc.) to users more quickly.

🧠 Main idea:
Instead of your content coming all the way from your original server (maybe in the USA),
 it comes from a nearby location — like Delhi, Mumbai, London, etc.

📦 Example:
You visit www.example.com from India
→ Instead of going to the USA server, the CDN serves your request from a server in Mumbai
→ Much faster! ✅

🧊 CDN stores copies of static content like:

Images, CSS, JS, videos, etc.

Sometimes even entire HTML pages

🛡️ Bonus: CDN also helps in protecting against DDoS attacks.

🟢 Step 2: What is DNS-based Routing?
DNS-based routing is the process of choosing which server (or location) to 
send the user to — based on DNS lookup and some logic like:

User's location (GeoDNS)

Server health/load

Latency

📦 Example:
You type www.example.com
→ Your browser asks DNS: “What is the IP of www.example.com?”
→ DNS provider looks at your location
→ If you're in India → returns IP of Mumbai server
→ If you're in Germany → returns IP of Frankfurt server

📌 This whole thing is called "DNS-based routing" (also called geo-routing or geo-DNS sometimes).

🟢 Step 3: How CDN uses DNS-based routing (Together)
Here’s the magic ✨

When you use a CDN (like Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS CloudFront), it acts like a smart 
DNS manager + static content server.

Here's what happens step by step:

🔹 Step 1: You type www.example.com
🔹 Step 2: Browser looks up DNS for example.com
🔹 Step 3: DNS-based routing happens → chooses closest CDN server
🔹 Step 4: Browser gets IP of nearest CDN edge server
🔹 Step 5: Browser sends request to that edge server
🔹 Step 6: CDN gives cached content (image, CSS, etc.)
     Or fetches it from your main server if needed
🔹 Step 7: Response is sent faster to the user ✅
