Example: You visit https://www.example.com

✅ Step 1: Browser Cache
🔍 First, your browser checks:
“Have I already looked up this domain recently?”
✅ If yes: use cached IP
❌ If no: go to next step

🧠 Browsers like Chrome/Firefox cache DNS entries for a few minutes.


✅ Step 2: OS Cache (System Cache)
🖥️ Your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux) checks:
“Is this domain in my local DNS cache?”
✅ If yes: use the IP address
❌ If not found: move to step 3


✅ Step 3: ISP's DNS Resolver (Recursive Resolver)
🌐 Your system asks your ISP’s DNS resolver:
“Do you know the IP address of www.example.com?”
✅ If resolver has it cached: done!
❌ If not: resolver will now perform the full DNS lookup on your behalf (next steps)


✅ Step 4: Root DNS Server
📡 Resolver now contacts a **Root DNS Server**

🌍 Root server doesn’t know the final IP, but replies:
“I don’t know the IP, but I can tell you where to find the .com servers”
✅ Root server returns the IP address of the TLD server for `.com`
🧠 There are 13 sets of root servers in the world (labeled A–M).


✅ Step 5: TLD (Top-Level Domain) DNS Server
🌐 Resolver now asks the `.com` DNS server:
“Where can I find example.com?”
✅ TLD server replies:
“Go ask the authoritative name server for example.com”
🧠 TLDs include .com, .org, .in, .dev, etc.

✅ Step 6: Authoritative DNS Server
📦 Resolver now contacts the Authoritative DNS Server for example.com:
“Please give me the IP for www.example.com”

✅ This server replies:
“Sure! IP = 93.184.216.34”
🧠 This is the final source of truth — owned by the domain's hosting provider or 
DNS host (like Cloudflare, GoDaddy, etc.)

✅ Step 7: Return the IP to Your Browser
🧠 Now the resolver has the answer.
📨 It returns the IP address to your operating system.
🧭 Your OS returns it to the browser.
🚀 Browser now sends an HTTP(S) request to that IP.

✅ Step 8: Cache the Result
🧠 The IP is now cached in:
- Your browser
- Your operating system
- Your ISP's DNS resolver

So next time, the DNS lookup is super fast.
