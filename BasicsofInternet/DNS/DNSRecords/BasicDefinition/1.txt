🧠 What are DNS Records? (Explained Clearly)
When you buy a domain like example.com, it’s like owning an empty piece of land.

But for the internet to know what to do when someone types that domain into the browser,
you have to give it instructions.

These instructions are called DNS records.

They are stored in a DNS zone file, which is a file maintained by your domain 
registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap) or a DNS hosting service (like Cloudflare).


❓1. Where do we set DNS records?
✅ You set them in the DNS Management panel of your domain registrar or your DNS hosting provider.

🎯 Examples:
If you bought your domain from GoDaddy, you log into GoDaddy → DNS settings →
 Add/Edit records (like A, CNAME, etc.)

If you use Cloudflare for DNS, then DNS settings are set in your Cloudflare dashboard.

If you're hosting on Vercel, and your domain is pointing to Vercel's nameservers, 
you'll set records in Vercel.

🔑2. Who gives us these DNS records (like A record, CNAME)?
✅ Your hosting provider (like Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.) gives you the DNS records to set.
