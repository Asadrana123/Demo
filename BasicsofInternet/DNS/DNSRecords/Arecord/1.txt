Address Record (A Record)
✅ What is an A Record?
An A record (Address Record) maps a domain name to an IPv4 address (e.g., 93.184.216.34).

💬 In short:
Domain name → IP address
Because browsers and servers understand IPs, not names.

📍 Why do we need this?
Humans type:

www.example.com
But computers talk in:

93.184.216.34
So, A record acts like a translator:

"Hey DNS! When someone types www.example.com, send them to 93.184.216.34"
🧠 Example:
Let’s say you have a website hosted on a server with this IP:

192.168.1.100
You buy a domain:

mycoolsite.com
You go to your DNS manager and set this A record:
