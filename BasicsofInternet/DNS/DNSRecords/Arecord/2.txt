💡 Key Details:
Feature	Explanation
IPv4 only	    A record only maps to IPv4 addresses (4-block, like 1.2.3.4)
Fast lookup	    It’s the most common and fastest DNS record
Required	    Almost every website needs at least one A record
One-to-many	    You can map multiple domains to same IP (many A records with same IP)
Load balancing	You can assign multiple A records to one domain — DNS will return them randomly or 
                in round-robin

***“It’s the IP address of a smart gateway (like a CDN or reverse proxy)
 that takes my request and routes it to the best, nearest actual server where my 
 site’s files are stored.”


Most users and hosts use A record for the root domain

and use CNAME for subdomain
