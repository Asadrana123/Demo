3️⃣ example ← Second-Level Domain (SLD)
This is the main part you choose when you register a domain.

You bought this from a domain registrar (like GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)

It must be unique under .com.

🧠 Think of it as:
Your home name (like “House of Asad” 🏡).

4️⃣ www ← Subdomain
Stands for “World Wide Web”

It’s just a nickname or a sub-section of your website.

Technically optional — example.com and www.example.com can be set up separately.

🧠 Think of it as:
A room in your house (like “living room” = main homepage).

You can also have:

blog.example.com

shop.example.com

admin.example.com

Each is a subdomain — part of the same house, but different rooms.

🌐 Why was “www” used originally?
Back in the 1990s and early 2000s:

Websites were often hosted on www.example.com to separate them from other services like:

ftp.example.com for file transfer

mail.example.com for email

It was a way to signal: “This is the website part.”

But now, it’s mostly optional and often just branding.



⚠️ Important: www.example.com ≠ example.com
They are actually treated as two different domains by DNS!

So:

You must configure both in DNS or your server if you want both to work.

Many people set up a redirect:

From www.example.com → example.com

Or from example.com → www.example.com

Example:

Visiting example.com redirects you to www.example.com — that’s a design decision.
