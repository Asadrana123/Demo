🔷 What is DMARC?
DMARC stands for:
🔐 Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance

It is a policy that tells receiving email servers:

"Here’s how to handle emails that fail SPF or DKIM, and please send me reports about it."

DMARC gives you:

Control

Protection

Visibility into email activity for your domain

🧠 Real-world analogy:
Imagine you run a company and hire two guards:

SPF checks if the person has an approved badge (who can send)

DKIM checks if their ID is legit and untouched (email is signed & safe)

Now, DMARC is the policy you write for the guards:

“If someone fails both ID and badge check — block them. Also, tell me who tried.”

🔄 How does DMARC work?
You publish a DMARC policy as a TXT record in your DNS

When an email arrives at someone’s inbox:

The recipient checks if SPF or DKIM passes

Then DMARC tells them what to do if they fail

The server sends reports back to you (if you ask for them)



✅ What does a DMARC record look like?
Example DNS TXT record:

_dmarc.asad.com  TXT
"v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:reports@asad.com"

Breakdown:

v=DMARC1 → Version
p=reject → Policy (reject, quarantine, or none)
rua=... → Where to send reports
