🛠️ Common Use Cases of TXT Records (Explained Simply)

1️⃣ Domain Verification (Used by Google, Facebook, etc.)
You sign up for Google Workspace and they ask:

“Prove this domain is yours.”

They give you a TXT value like:

"google-site-verification=AbC123xYz987"
✅ You add it to your domain’s DNS settings.

🔍 Google checks:
“Does asad.com have this TXT record?”
If yes → Domain verified!


SPF

SPF (Sender Policy Framework) is an email security mechanism that:
✅ Tells the world which mail servers are allowed to send emails on behalf of your domain.

Example:
   If your domain is asad.com,
   SPF helps prevent spammers from sending fake emails like:
   "From: support@asad.com" — using some random server.
