What is a TXT Record?
TXT (Text) record is a type of DNS record that allows a domain owner to attach 
human-readable or machine-readable information to their domain.

🧠 Why is it used?
Originally, TXT records were meant for humans to attach any information they wanted.

🧠 Why did humans want to attach information?
Because they wanted to:

✅ Leave public comments or instructions

Example:
v=info Contact admin@asad.com for support.

✅ Add copyright or organization details

Example:
v=org Asad Web Services, India.

✅ Make internal notes for other admins

Example:
v=internal Migrated from old DNS server in 2020.

✅ Share public keys or debug info

Example:
v=debug Mail server moved to 192.168.1.20

🟡 But later, people found smarter uses…
Over time, big services (like Google, Gmail, Microsoft, etc.) realized:

“Hey, we can use TXT records to publish security data — like SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and domain verification keys.”

So now, TXT records are mostly used by machines, but originally they were meant for humans.
