🧰 Step-by-step: What happens when an email is sent to asad.com
💌 Someone sends an email to hello@asad.com

📬 The sending mail server looks up the MX record of asad.com

📡 It gets a response like:

10 mail1.asad.com
20 mail2.asad.com


🚀 It tries to connect to mail1.asad.com (highest priority)
✅ If it connects, it delivers the email
❌ If that fails, it tries mail2.asad.com instead
