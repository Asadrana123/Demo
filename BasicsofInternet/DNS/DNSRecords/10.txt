🟡 What is DKIM?
DKIM stands for DomainKeys Identified Mail.

It is an email security standard that:
✅ Adds a digital signature to your email
✅ Lets the receiver verify:
 ✔️ The email really came from your domain
 ✔️ The content hasn’t been tampered with in transit

🧠 Think of it like this:
Imagine you're sending a letter.
You seal it with a wax stamp that has your unique logo.

When someone receives the letter, they look at that stamp and say:
✔️ “Yep, this really came from Asad — and nobody changed it.”

That “stamp” in email is DKIM’s digital signature.

🔧 How does DKIM work (step by step)?
You send an email (e.g. from support@asad.com via Gmail or your server)

Your mail server adds a DKIM signature in the email’s header
 👉 It uses a private key to sign it (this key stays secret)

The receiving mail server (like Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
 ➤ Looks up your public key from your DNS (via a TXT record)

It verifies the signature using the public key:
 ✔️ If it matches → Email is trusted
 ❌ If not → Email may be flagged as spam or rejected
