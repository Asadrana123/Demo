Address Record (A Record)
✅ What is an A Record?
An A record (Address Record) maps a domain name to an IPv4 address (e.g., 93.184.216.34).

💬 In short:
Domain name → IP address
Because browsers and servers understand IPs, not names.

📍 Why do we need this?
Humans type:

www.example.com
But computers talk in:

93.184.216.34
So, A record acts like a translator:

"Hey DNS! When someone types www.example.com, send them to 93.184.216.34"
🧠 Example:
Let’s say you have a website hosted on a server with this IP:

192.168.1.100
You buy a domain:

mycoolsite.com
You go to your DNS manager and set this A record:

Type	Name	Value
A	@ (or mycoolsite.com)	192.168.1.100

Now when anyone types mycoolsite.com → DNS returns 192.168.1.100 → browser connects to that server.

💡 Key Details:
Feature	Explanation
IPv4 only	    A record only maps to IPv4 addresses (4-block, like 1.2.3.4)
Fast lookup	    It’s the most common and fastest DNS record
Required	    Almost every website needs at least one A record
One-to-many	    You can map multiple domains to same IP (many A records with same IP)
Load balancing	You can assign multiple A records to one domain — DNS will return them randomly or 
                in round-robin

🧪 Real DNS A Record

A   mycoolsite.com   93.184.216.34
If someone types mycoolsite.com, the DNS response will be:

Resolved IP: 93.184.216.34
Browser now connects directly to that IP.

***“It’s the IP address of a smart gateway (like a CDN or reverse proxy)
 that takes my request and routes it to the best, nearest actual server where my 
 site’s files are stored.”


Most users and hosts use A record for the root domain

and use CNAME for subdomain
