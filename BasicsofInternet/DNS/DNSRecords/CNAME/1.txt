🔸 CNAME Record (Canonical Name)
What it does:
It creates an alias. It says: “Instead of pointing to an IP, point to another domain.”

Why it exists:
Because sometimes you don’t know the IP address
(e.g., using platforms like GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc.) — they handle the IP internally.

So instead of giving you an IP, they say:
“Set your CNAME to something like your-project.vercel.app”

Example:
www.example.com → your-site.vercel.app


🤔 So why do we need CNAME if we can just use A?
Because CNAME brings flexibility, indirection, and centralized control — 
especially in real-life SaaS, cloud, and multi-environment setups.
