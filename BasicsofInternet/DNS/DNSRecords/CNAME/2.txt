✅ Solid Real-Life Example: Using Cloudflare / AWS / Netlify / Vercel
🏗 Scenario: You have a main website hosted on Vercel
Their root server domain looks like:

your-project.vercel.app → 76.76.21.21
You want your domain to be:


www.asaddev.com
❌ Option 1: Using A Record
You'd have to manually find the IP Vercel uses (e.g. 76.76.21.21) and then add:


A   www.asaddev.com   →   76.76.21.21
Problems:

If Vercel changes their server IP → your site breaks

You have to maintain it manually

Not scalable or portable

✅ Option 2: Using CNAME Record
You just point your domain to the domain they gave you:


CNAME   www.asaddev.com   →   your-project.vercel.app
💡 Now Vercel can change their IP behind the scenes, but your domain still works!

✅ You get flexibility
✅ Zero IP maintenance
✅ Vercel manages the A record behind the scenes
✅ Works even with CDN, load balancers, etc.
