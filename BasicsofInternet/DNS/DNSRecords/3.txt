🧱 Full Breakdown of www.example.com
Here’s the full domain structure:


www.example.com.
Yes, it actually has a dot at the end — representing the root of the DNS hierarchy. But browsers hide it.

Now let’s go layer by layer from right to left:

1️⃣ . ← Root Domain (hidden)
Think of this as the top of the internet’s domain name system.

It’s controlled by an organization called ICANN.

You never type this, but DNS always includes it.

🧠 Think of it as:
The globe 🌍 — where the internet’s address system starts.

2️⃣ .com ← Top-Level Domain (TLD)
TLD means the “category” of the website.

.com = commercial

.org = organization

.edu = education

.in, .uk, .de = country-specific TLDs

🧠 Think of it as:
The country or region on the globe. 🗺️

3️⃣ example ← Second-Level Domain (SLD)
This is the main part you choose when you register a domain.

You bought this from a domain registrar (like GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)

It must be unique under .com.

🧠 Think of it as:
Your home name (like “House of Asad” 🏡).

4️⃣ www ← Subdomain
Stands for “World Wide Web”

It’s just a nickname or a sub-section of your website.

Technically optional — example.com and www.example.com can be set up separately.

🧠 Think of it as:
A room in your house (like “living room” = main homepage).

You can also have:

blog.example.com

shop.example.com

admin.example.com

Each is a subdomain — part of the same house, but different rooms.

🌐 Why was “www” used originally?
Back in the 1990s and early 2000s:

Websites were often hosted on www.example.com to separate them from other services like:

ftp.example.com for file transfer

mail.example.com for email

It was a way to signal: “This is the website part.”

But now, it’s mostly optional and often just branding.



⚠️ Important: www.example.com ≠ example.com
They are actually treated as two different domains by DNS!

So:

You must configure both in DNS or your server if you want both to work.

Many people set up a redirect:

From www.example.com → example.com

Or from example.com → www.example.com

Example:

Visiting example.com redirects you to www.example.com — that’s a design decision.
