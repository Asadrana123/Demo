🟡 What is an MX Record?
MX (Mail Exchange) record is a type of DNS record that tells the world:

“If you want to send email to me (like to hello@asad.com), here’s where you should deliver that email.”

🔁 In simple terms:
It maps a domain name to the mail server responsible for handling emails for that domain.

🧠 Why is it needed?
Let’s say someone wants to send an email to:


hello@asad.com
To deliver this email, the sender's mail server must figure out:

“Where is the email server that handles mail for asad.com?”

It does this by checking the MX record of asad.com.


🔍 Example MX Records for asad.com:

Priority    Mail Server
10          mail1.asad.com
20          mail2.asad.com
