✅ STEP-BY-STEP NETWORKING ROADMAP FOR FRONT-END ENGINEERS
🧠 1. Basic Networking Concepts
Start with fundamentals:
What is the Internet & how it works
IP Address (IPv4 vs IPv6)
MAC Address
DNS (Domain Name System)
TCP vs UDP
HTTP vs HTTPS
Ports

👉 You’ll understand how clients (like browsers) communicate with servers.

🌐 2. The OSI Model (7 Layers)
This is crucial to understand how data moves through a network:

Physical Layer

Data Link Layer

Network Layer (IP)

Transport Layer (TCP/UDP)

Session Layer

Presentation Layer

Application Layer (HTTP)

👉 Focus more on Layer 4–7, as they’re most relevant to web development.

🔗 3. HTTP/HTTPS – The Core of Web Communication
Deep dive into:

HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)

Status codes (200, 404, 500, etc.)

Request/Response headers

Cookies vs LocalStorage vs SessionStorage

HTTPS (SSL/TLS and how encryption works)

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

Same-Origin Policy

👉 This will help you debug browser requests, build secure apps, and handle APIs.

🌍 4. DNS & Domain Names
Understand how your browser converts www.google.com to an IP:

DNS Lookup process

DNS Records (A, CNAME, MX, TXT)

CDN & DNS-based routing

👉 Useful when configuring custom domains and troubleshooting deployment.

🛰 5. APIs & REST
You’ll work with APIs almost daily:

REST vs GraphQL

RESTful design principles

Fetch / Axios (network libraries)

API versioning

Rate limiting

Authentication: API keys, JWT, OAuth

👉 Learn how to integrate, test, and secure APIs.

🔐 6. Authentication & Security
Security is crucial:

HTTPS (SSL/TLS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Content Security Policy (CSP)

Secure cookies

Token storage (JWT in HttpOnly cookies vs localStorage)

👉 Frontend engineers must know how to handle security risks properly.

📦 7. Web Performance & CDN
Learn how networking impacts performance:

Latency, Bandwidth

Caching (browser, server-side, CDN)

Cache-Control & ETags

CDNs (Cloudflare, Akamai, etc.)

Lazy loading & prefetching

👉 Improves loading speed and user experience.

🧪 8. Browser DevTools – Network Tab
Use tools like Chrome DevTools to:

Inspect HTTP requests/responses

Monitor network waterfalls

Identify bottlenecks

Understand caching behavior

👉 Be comfortable debugging real-world issues.

🌐 9. WebSockets & Real-Time Communication
Understand:

WebSockets vs HTTP

Server-Sent Events (SSE)

Polling vs Long Polling

Real-time updates (chat, notifications, etc.)

👉 Useful for modern front-end apps with real-time features.

🚀 10. Deployment & Hosting Basics
How front-end code reaches the user:

Domain setup (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)

Hosting (Netlify, Vercel, Firebase, AWS S3)

DNS propagation

Environment variables & HTTPS certs

👉 You’ll know how to deploy and debug your apps like a pro.
