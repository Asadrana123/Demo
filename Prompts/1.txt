Now I have implemented the full code or front end challenge now your term is to tell me what things
I have done wrong, if we think about production ready code so think like a senoir 
software engineer because I am preparing for front end engineer for more than 1 year experience, tell me my mistakes step 
by step and only one step at once


Now give me another front end challenge which will force me to push my
limits and as you know I am preparing for front end engineer role or interview for more than 
1 year experience I want to practice challenges which are related to inteview or machine coding round


For code improvement:-
it is front end task solved by me, review its 1. Readability 2. Reusablity of components 3. 
seperation of concerns 4. state managment discipline 5.Performance Consciousness 6. scalability 7. 
code quality 8. optimization 9. maintainablity 10. file and folder strcuture 11. and all other things
which you think are important for me as preparation for interview 12. give me suggestions to imropve
but only one suggestion at once
