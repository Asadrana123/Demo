react-window is a lightweight library for rendering large lists and grids efficiently in React.

Normally, if you render a list of, say, 10,000 items, React will try to render all of them
 into the DOM. That causes:

Slow rendering

High memory usage

Janky scrolling

ðŸ‘‰ react-window solves this by using a technique called windowing (or virtualization).
It only renders the items that are visible in the viewport (plus a small buffer), and as you scroll,
it dynamically reuses DOM elements to display the next visible items.
