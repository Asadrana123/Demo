The ::after pseudo-element in CSS is used to insert content after the content of a 
selected element (but still inside that element). It’s commonly used for decorative purposes, 
such as 
adding icons, symbols, or extra text, without modifying your HTML.


Example:
p::after {
  content: " ★";
  color: gold;
}

If your HTML is:
<p>Hello</p>
Then the browser will display:
Hello ★

Some key points:
::after creates a virtual last child within the selected element.
It is not part of the document’s HTML (only in CSS).
You can style it just like a normal element: add color, margin, background, etc.
This helps you keep your HTML cleaner and separates structure from presentation.
