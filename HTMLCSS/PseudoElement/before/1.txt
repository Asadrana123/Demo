Step 1: What is ::before?
The ::before pseudo-element lets you insert content just before the content of an element.
It behaves as if it's the first child inside the element.
You must always use the content property; otherwise, the ::before element wonâ€™t appear.
Commonly used for decorative purposes, icons, quotes, or extra info without changing the HTML.
