Suppose you want to add a colored dot before each item in a list.
If you do it in HTML, your code becomes repetitive and less clean:

<ul>
  <li><span class="dot"></span>Item 1</li>
  <li><span class="dot"></span>Item 2</li>
  <li><span class="dot"></span>Item 3</li>
</ul>


With ::before, your HTML stays clean:


li::before {
  content: '●';           /* Adds a dot before each item */
  color: red;             /* Makes the dot red */
  margin-right: 8px;      /* Adds some space after the dot */
}

What happens? A red dot appears before every list item—without any additional HTML!
This keeps your HTML semantic and lets you add or remove decoration easily just by adjusting 
CSS.
