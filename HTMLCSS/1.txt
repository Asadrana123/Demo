Difference between align-items and align-content
both align-items and align-content  
have same work but one work with one new line and other one work with multiple lines


Flexbox:-
flex-shrink:-flex-shrink controls how much a flex item shrinks when there’s not enough space in the container.
flex-grow:- It tells about how will item grow if we change the size of the container.
flex-basis:-flex-basis sets the initial/main size of a flex item before any shrinking (flex-shrink) or growing
(flex-grow) happens.

flex:- flex-grow value flex-shrink value flex-basis value

.item {
  flex-basis: 200px;
  width: 100px;
}
In a flex container:
The item’s base size = 200px (from flex-basis, not width).
width: 100px is ignored in this context.

align-self:-
You have multiple items in a flex container.
You want one specific item to align differently vertically (in a row layout) or horizontally (in a column layout).

.item {
  align-self: flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
}

padding short combo:-
1.<all-sides>
2.<vertical> <horizontal>
3.<top> <horizontal> <bottom>
4.<top> <right> <bottom> <left>
