DIFFERENCE BETWEEN position: absolute AND position: fixed

| Feature                 | position: absolute                          | position: fixed                             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Reference Point        | Nearest positioned ancestor (relative/abs)  | Viewport (browser window)                   |
| Scroll Behavior        | Moves with scroll                           | Stays fixed during scroll                   |
| Depends on Parent?     | ✅ Yes (if parent is positioned)             | ❌ No (ignores all parent positions)         |
| Use Cases              | Tooltips, overlays inside containers        | Headers, menus, back-to-top buttons         |
| Responsive to Viewport | ❌ No                                        | ✅ Yes                                       |
| Used for Sticky UIs?   | ❌ Rarely                                    | ✅ Commonly                                  |
| Parent Clipping Risk   | ✅ Yes (can be hidden if parent has overflow)| ❌ No (not affected by parent overflow)      |

KEY SUMMARY:
- `absolute`: positioned **relative to a parent**, scrolls with page.
- `fixed`: positioned **relative to the viewport**, **does not scroll**.

EXAMPLE DIFFERENCE:
→ absolute inside a scrollable div will move with content.
→ fixed stays pinned in place on screen even when scrolling.
