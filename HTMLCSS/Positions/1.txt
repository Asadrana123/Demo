CSS POSITION: RELATIVE (In-Depth Guide)

/* BASIC DEFINITION */
position: relative;
→ Positions the element **relative to its normal position** in the document flow.
→ The element still **takes up its original space**.
→ You can then use offset properties: top, right, bottom, left.

/* KEY POINTS */
1. The element stays in the document flow (does NOT get removed like absolute).
2. It can be moved visually using offset values (top, left, etc.).
3. Other elements behave as if the element is still in its original position.

/* OFFSET PROPERTIES */
top: 10px;     → Moves element 10px DOWN from where it would normally be.
left: 20px;    → Moves element 20px RIGHT from its normal position.
right, bottom  → Same logic, but from opposite directions.

/* COMMON USE CASES */
- Nudging an element slightly without removing it from flow.
- Creating a reference point for absolutely positioned children.

Example:
<div style="position: relative; top: 20px; left: 10px;">
  I have been shifted from my original spot!
</div>

/* RELATIVE + ABSOLUTE COMBO */
If a parent is `position: relative` and child is `position: absolute`, then:
→ The absolutely positioned child is placed relative to the parent.

Example:
<div style="position: relative;">
  Parent
  <div style="position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0;">
    Child positioned in top-right corner of parent
  </div>
</div>

/* DOESN'T AFFECT LAYOUT AROUND IT */
Even if a relatively positioned element moves, other elements behave as if it hasn’t.
