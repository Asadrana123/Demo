Exactly ✅ — in CSS selectors, the space matters a lot.

A space means “any descendant” (at any depth).

A > means “direct child.”

No space means “the element itself.”

Example:
<div class="filters-container">
  <div>Child 1</div>
  <div>Child 2</div>
  <div>
    <span>Nested 1</span>
    <span>Nested 2</span>
  </div>
</div>

1. With a space:
.filters-container :nth-child(2) {
  color: red;
}


👉 This will select:

the 2nd <div> inside .filters-container

the 2nd <span> inside the nested <div>
(basically, any 2nd child anywhere inside).

2. With direct child >:
.filters-container > :nth-child(2) {
  color: blue;
}


👉 This will select only the 2nd <div> inside .filters-container (not the <span>s).

3. Without space:
.filters-container:nth-child(2) {
  color: green;
}


👉 This will style the .filters-container itself, but only if it is the 2nd child of its parent.

⚡So yes — the space changes the whole meaning.
