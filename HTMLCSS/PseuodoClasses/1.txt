Step 1: What Are CSS Pseudo-classes?
Definition:
A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected 
element(s).

Syntax Example:

selector:pseudo-class {
  /* styles here */
}
Example:

button:hover {
  background: blue;
}
Core Idea:
Pseudo-classes let you style elements not just by their tag, class, or ID, but by their state
or position in the document, such as:

When the mouse is over a button
When a link has already been visited
When an input is focused
When a list item is the first or last child

What Can They Be Used For?

Styling interactivity (hover, focus)
Styling based on element position (first, last, nth-child)
Styling form validation states (valid, invalid)
Targeting elements based on user actions or browser state
You DON’T need JavaScript for these—they’re purely CSS!
