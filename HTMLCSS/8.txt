DIFFERENCE BETWEEN position: sticky AND position: fixed

| Feature                  | position: sticky                             | position: fixed                              |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Reference Point          | Nearest scrollable ancestor (like relative)  | Viewport (browser window)                     |
| Scroll Behavior          | Scrolls with content until a point, then "sticks" | Does NOT scroll with content (always fixed) |
| Offset Properties Work?  | ✅ Yes                                        | ✅ Yes                                         |
| Stays in Flow Initially? | ✅ Yes (acts like relative at first)         | ❌ No (removed from flow)                      |
| Removed from Flow?       | ❌ No                                         | ✅ Yes                                         |
| Triggers Sticky Behavior | When scroll reaches the defined offset       | Instantly fixed based on defined offset       |
| Parent Clipping Risk     | ✅ Yes (clipped if parent has `overflow: hidden`) | ❌ No (not affected by parent overflow)   |
| Use Case Example         | Sticky table headers, section titles         | Navbar, chat button, back-to-top button       |

-----------------------
POSITION: STICKY (EXPLANATION)

→ Hybrid between `relative` and `fixed`.
→ Element scrolls with content until it hits a defined offset (e.g., `top: 0`), then "sticks" in place.
→ Once its parent is out of view, it disappears with it.
→ Requires a scrollable ancestor to work correctly.

Example:
<div style="position: sticky; top: 0;">I stick to the top while scrolling</div>

-----------------------
POSITION: FIXED (EXPLANATION)

→ Fully removed from the normal document flow.
→ Always fixed to a position relative to the viewport.
→ Does not move when you scroll.
→ Always visible (unless manually hidden).

Example:
<div style="position: fixed; top: 0; width: 100%;">I stay at the top no matter what</div>

-----------------------
KEY DIFFERENCE SUMMARY:

- Sticky: Starts like `relative`, becomes `fixed` when scroll reaches offset.
- Fixed: Always stuck


 Sticky only works when:
It can scroll with its container.
It has room to reach the sticky threshold.
It’s not clipped out of visibility.
