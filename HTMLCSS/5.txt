CSS POSITION: ABSOLUTE (In-Depth Guide)

/* BASIC DEFINITION */
position: absolute;
→ Removes the element completely from the normal document flow.
→ The element no longer affects or is affected by other elements.
→ You must use offsets (top, right, bottom, left) to position it.

/* HOW IT WORKS */
1. The element is positioned relative to its **nearest positioned ancestor**.
   → That means the closest parent with:
     position: relative / absolute / fixed / sticky.

2. If no such ancestor exists, it's positioned relative to the entire <html> (viewport).

/* OFFSET PROPERTIES (used with position: absolute) */
top: 20px;      → 20px from the top of the positioned ancestor
left: 30px;     → 30px from the left of the positioned ancestor
right: 0;       → Flush against the right edge
bottom: 0;      → Flush against the bottom edge

/* IMPORTANT: REMOVED FROM FLOW */
- Other elements behave as if the absolutely positioned element doesn’t exist.
- It will not push or be pushed by siblings.

/* COMMON USE CASES */
- Popups, tooltips, dropdowns
- Stacking elements (z-index works)
- Positioning elements inside a relatively positioned container

/* EXAMPLE */
<div style="position: relative;">
  Parent Box
  <div style="position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0;">
    This child is pinned to the top-right corner
  </div>
</div>

/* RELATION TO PARENT */
- If parent has position: relative → child uses it as reference
- If parent has no position → child uses the page (viewport) as reference
