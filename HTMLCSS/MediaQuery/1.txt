What is a Media Query?
A media query in CSS is a way to apply styles based on the characteristics of the device 
(like its width, height, orientation, etc.).
Use case: You want your website to look different on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Basic Structure of a Media Query:
@media [media-type] and ([condition]) {
  /* CSS rules here */
}

@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
