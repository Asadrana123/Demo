CSS POSITION: FIXED (In-Depth Guide)

/* BASIC DEFINITION */
position: fixed;
‚Üí Removes the element from the normal document flow.
‚Üí Positions the element relative to the **viewport** (browser window), not any parent.
‚Üí It stays fixed in place even when the page is scrolled.

/* KEY CHARACTERISTICS */
1. Element is completely taken out of the flow.
2. Uses offset properties: top, right, bottom, left.
3. Remains visible at the same position on screen, regardless of scrolling.

/* OFFSET PROPERTIES */
top: 0;       ‚Üí Pin element to top edge of the screen
left: 0;      ‚Üí Pin to the left side
right: 0;     ‚Üí Pin to the right side
bottom: 0;    ‚Üí Pin to the bottom

/* DOES NOT RESPOND TO PARENT POSITION */
Unlike absolute, fixed does NOT care about parent positioning.
‚Üí It is always relative to the viewport.

/* COMMON USE CASES */
- Sticky headers
- Back to top buttons
- Fixed navigation bars
- Floating chat or help buttons

/* EXAMPLE */
<div style="position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; background: black; color: white;">
  This header stays at the top of the page even when you scroll
</div>

/* FIXED IS POWERFUL BUT TRICKY */
- Often used with z-index to stay above other content
- Be careful: fixed elements can overlap or hide content if not styled carefully
