|      PROPERTY      |            DESCRIPTION              |
------------------------------------------------------------
| transform          | - Applies visual transformations    |
|                    |   like rotate, scale, translate,    |
|                    |   skew directly to an element.      |
|                    | - Has immediate effect unless       |
|                    |   combined with transition/animation|
|                    | - Syntax:                          |
|                    |   transform: rotate(45deg);         |
------------------------------------------------------------
| transition         | - Animates property changes         |
|                    |   smoothly over time.               |
|                    | - Requires a trigger (e.g., hover,  |
|                    |   class change).                    |
|                    | - Can't repeat automatically.       |
|                    | - Syntax:                          |
|                    |   transition: transform 0.5s ease;  |
------------------------------------------------------------
| animation          | - Keyframe-based animation over time|
|                    | - Can loop, pause, reverse, delay.  |
|                    | - Does not need user interaction.   |
|                    | - More control than transition.     |
|                    | - Syntax:                          |
|                    |   animation: moveBox 2s infinite;   |
|                    |   @keyframes moveBox {              |
|                    |     from { transform: translateX(0); }|
|                    |     to { transform: translateX(100px); }|
|                    |   }                                 |

# Summary:
- transform: Defines the change.
- transition: Animates the change on trigger.
- animation: Runs keyframed sequences automatically.


position:absolute:
top: 50%; and left: 50%;
This places the top-left corner of the .inner-dot at 50% from the top and 50% from the left of the .loader.
But at this point, the dot's top-left corner is centered, not the center of the dot.
ðŸ”¹ transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
This shifts the element back by 50% of its own width and height, effectively centering the dot itself.
-50% in X-axis â†’ moves it leftward by half its own width.
-50% in Y-axis â†’ moves it upward by half its own height.
