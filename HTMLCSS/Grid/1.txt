Grid:-
.grid-container{
    display: grid;
    background-color: blueviolet;
    padding: 10px;
    row-gap: 1rem;
    column-gap: 1rem;
    grid-template-columns: 100px 100px;
    grid-template-rows: 100px;
} 

But that only defines the size of the first row and columns — it doesn’t limit the grid to just 1 row.
If you place more than 2 items, new rows will be created automatically to accommodate them — even though 
only the first row’s height is explicitly defined (100px), the next rows will auto-size (usually to auto).

If you do not give a fixed height (like height: 100vh; or height: 500px;) to the container, then 1fr 
means nothing 

Grid-template-areas:-
"grid-template-areas lets you define named areas on a CSS grid, making layout easier to 
read and manage."
