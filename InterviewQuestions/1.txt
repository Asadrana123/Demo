Current work:
Currently working as a Software Developer at Rangi Lalls, building the auction platform interface 
for Vihara AI with real-time bidding updates and UI performance optimization. Work focuses on 
creating faster, smoother bidding experiences through targeted front-end improvements. 
Responsibilities include client-side validation and error handling to improve reliability, 
along with building responsive interfaces for modern applications.

Projects:
- Vihara AI (Auction UI): Real-time bid updates, clear status and error messages, responsive layouts, 
reusable components for a smooth bidding experience.
- ChatWave: Next.js chat interface with user search, group chats, image and text messaging, 
and simple in-app notifications using Chakra UI.
- LinkUp: Next.js social app interface for posts, comments, likes, image uploads, and simple 
sign-in flows with clean, responsive UI using Tailwind/Material UI.

Willing to relocate:
Yes, open to relocating and happy to plan a smooth transition with clear timelines.

Project types:
- Real-time user interfaces (bidding, chat, notifications).
- Social and community UIs (feeds, posts, comments, likes).
- Responsive, accessible web apps built with React/Next.js and modern UI libraries.

Challenges faced (Vihara AI):
- Keeping live bid updates smooth during fast changes on the screen.
- Making pages feel fast even with constant activity and real-time events.
- Showing clear messages for form checks and errors to keep flows simple.
- Keeping layouts usable on many devices and screen sizes.
- Turning designs into reusable parts while keeping the look the same.
