1. What is your actual work currently?

Currently, I am working as a Software Developer at Rangi Lalls, where I focus on the frontend 
development of a full-stack auction platform. My role involves building responsive and user-friendly
interfaces using React, ensuring smooth real-time updates with WebSockets, and optimizing performance 
for a seamless user experience. I also work on improving validation and error handling on the client 
side to maintain reliability in production.


3. Tell me about your projects.

*"I have worked on several projects:
ChatWave: A chat application built with Node.js, Next.js, and MongoDB. It supports user search, 
group chat, real-time messaging, notifications, and even has an integrated AI chatbot.

LinkUp: A social media web app built with Next.js and Firebase, featuring image sharing, commenting,
liking, and Google authentication.

Auction Platform (Vihara AI): A full-stack MERN application with real-time bidding, admin dashboards,
and performance-optimized communication channels.


What type of projects have you made?
Most of my projects are full-stack web applications focused on real-time communication and user
engagement. For example, chat applications, social media platforms, and an auction system. Iâ€™ve 
worked extensively with React, Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and WebSockets to deliver scalable, 
high-performance applications. My projects emphasize both functionality and user experience.
