1. What is your actual work currently?

Currently, I am working as a Software Developer at Rangi Lalls, where I am developing a 
full-stack auction platform using the MERN stack. My role involves building real-time features 
with WebSockets, optimizing performance, and ensuring a smooth user experience. I also focus on 
robust error handling and validation to maintain a reliable production system.
