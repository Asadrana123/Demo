âœ… What is fetch?
fetch() is a built-in JavaScript function used to make HTTP requests 
(like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) from the browser.

Think of fetch() like a way for your frontend code to talk to a backend server or API, 
just like how we use WhatsApp to send messages.

fetch(url, options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // use the data here
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // handle errors
  });


Summary: Understanding fetch, Response, and Reading Data
1. What does fetch return?
fetch() returns a Response object, not the actual data.

This object contains metadata (status, headers) and the body as a stream.

2. What is the response body?
The body is a stream of bytes/text, like a pipe delivering data in chunks.

It is not the complete data yet and can only be read once.

3. Why is the response body a stream (sealed box) instead of fully ready data?
Streaming lets your app start processing data before the entire response arrives.

It improves performance and memory efficiency, especially for large files.

Gives flexibility to read data as JSON, text, blob, etc.
