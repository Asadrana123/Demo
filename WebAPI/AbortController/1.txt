The first thing you need to do is create a controller object that will let you later cancel a request.

// Step 1: Create an AbortController
const controller = new AbortController();

controller is now an instance of AbortController.
This object has a signal property and an abort() method (we’ll use them in the next steps).


Step 2: Access the signal from the controller
const signal = controller.signal;

The signal is an object you will pass to an async operation, like fetch.
It tells the operation: “Listen to this signal so I can abort if needed.”



// Step 1: Create an AbortController
const controller = new AbortController();

// Step 2: Get the signal from the controller
const signal = controller.signal;

// Step 3: Use the signal with fetch
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1', { signal })

// Step 4: Abort the fetch request after 2 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
  controller.abort();
}, 2000);
