Step 1: What is URLSearchParams and Where Does It Come From?
URLSearchParams is a built-in browser API (part of the modern JavaScript spec, but implemented by 
browsers).
It provides convenient methods to work with the query string (“search parameters”) 
of a URL—like ?user=123&type=admin.

It is not a standalone JavaScript feature, but a Web API, so it works in browsers 
(and some server environments that mimic browser APIs, like Deno or recent Node.js).

You don't need to install or import anything; the object is available globally in browsers as part of 
the window's environment.

Summary:
URLSearchParams is part of the browser’s native JavaScript APIs for working with the search/query 
portion of URLs.
