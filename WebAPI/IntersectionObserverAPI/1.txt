Step 1: What is Intersection Observer API?
It’s a browser API for asynchronously watching when an element enters, exits, or crosses certain 
thresholds of visibility within a container or the viewport.

It replaces traditional scroll event listeners for detecting visibility with a highly performant, 
event-driven mechanism.

Useful for lazy loading images, infinite scrolling, animations on scroll, and more.

✅ Options you can pass:

root

The element used as the viewport for checking visibility.

Default: null → which means the browser viewport itself.

Example: root: document.querySelector(".scroll-container")

rootMargin

A margin around the root element, like CSS margin.

Values: pixels (px) or percentages (%).

Useful for triggering earlier or later.

Example: "0px 0px -100px 0px" → start observing 100px before the element leaves the viewport.

threshold

A single number (0 to 1) or an array of numbers.

Defines how much of the target must be visible to trigger the callback.

Example:
0 → trigger as soon as even 1px is visible.
1.0 → trigger only when the entire element is visible.
[0, 0.5, 1] → trigger at multiple stages (0%, 50%, 100%).
