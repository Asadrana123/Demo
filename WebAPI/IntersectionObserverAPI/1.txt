Step 1: What is Intersection Observer API?
Itâ€™s a browser API for asynchronously watching when an element enters, exits, or crosses certain 
thresholds of visibility within a container or the viewport.

It replaces traditional scroll event listeners for detecting visibility with a highly performant, 
event-driven mechanism.

Useful for lazy loading images, infinite scrolling, animations on scroll, and more.
